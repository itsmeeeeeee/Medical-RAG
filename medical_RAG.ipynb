            "The peripheral nervous system is divided into two subcategories: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system.\n",
            "The somatic nervous system is liable for carrying sensory information from the sense organs to the central nervous system as well as carrying motor instructions to the muscles.\n",
            "The autonomic nervous system can also be further divided into two subcategories.\n",
            "The sympathetic nervous system is the part of the autonomic nervous system that is responsible for fight or flight response, and the parasympathetic nervous system is in charge of resting states and conserving energy.\n",

            "In addition the cerebral cortex is related to conscious life.\n",
            "It is divided into two parts, central and peripheral.\n",
            "The central nervous system have the encephalon or brain,contained within the cranium, and the medulla spinalis or spinal cord,lodged in the vertebral canal; the two portions are continuous with one another at the level of the upper border of the atlas vertebra.\n",
            "The peripheral nervous system comprises a series of nerves by which the central nervous system is connected with the diverse tissues of the body.\n",
            "For descriptive purposes these nerves may be arranged in two groups, cerebrospinal and sympathetic, the arrangement, however, being an arbitrary one, since the two groups are intimately connected and closely intermingled.\n",
            "Both the cerebrospinal and sympathetic nerves have nuclei of origin (the somatic efferent and sympathetic efferent) as well as nuclei of termination (somatic afferent and sympathetic afferent) in the central nervous system.\n",
            "Tere are forty three cerebrospinal nerves on either side— twelve cranial, attached to the brain, and thirty-one spinal, to the medulla spinalis.\n",
            "They are associated with the functions of the special and general senses and with the voluntary movements of the body.\n",
            "The sympathetic nerves transmit the impulses which regulate the movements of the viscera, determine the caliber of the bloodvessels, and control the phenomena of secretion.\n",
            "Related to them are two rows ofcentral ganglia, situated one on either side of the middle line in front of the vertebral column; these ganglia are intimately related to the medulla spinalis and the spinal nerves, and are also joined to each other by vertical strands of nerve fibers so as to constitute a pair of knotted cords, the sympathetic trunks, which reach from the base of the skull to the coccyx.\n",
            "The sympathetic nerves issuing from the ganglia form three great prevertebral plexuses which supply the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic viscera; in relation to the walls of these viscera intricate nerve plexuses and numerous peripheral ganglia are found.\n",
            "Generally nervous tissues are made of nerve cells and their various processes, together with a supporting tissue called neuroglia, which, however, is found only in the brain and medulla spinalis.\n",
            "Some long processes of the nerve cells are of special significance, and it is convenient to consider them apart from the cells; they are known as nerve fibers.\n",
            "To the naked eye a difference is obvious between certain portions of the brain and medulla spinalis, viz., the gray substance and the white substance.\n",
            "The gray substance is largely composed of nerve cells, while the white substance contains only their long processes, the nerve fibers.\n",
            "It is in the former that nervous impressions are received, stored, and transformed into efferent impulses, and by the latter\n",
            "that they are conducted.\n",
            "Hence the gray substance forms the essential constituent of all the ganglionic centers, both those in the isolated ganglia and those aggregated in the brain and medulla spinalis; while the white substance forms the bulk of the commissural portions of the nerve centers and the peripheral nerves.\n",
            "Neuroglia is the peculiar ground substance in which the true nervous constituents of the brain and medulla spinalis are imbedded.\n",
            "It consists of cells and fibers.\n",
            "Some of the cells are stellate in shape, with ill-defined cell body, and their fine processes become neuroglia fibers, which extend radially and unbranched among the nerve cells and fibers which they aid in supporting.\n",
            "Other cells give off fibers which branch repeatedly.\n",
            "Some of the fibers start from the epithelial cells lining the ventricles of the brain and central canal of the medulla spinalis, and pass through the nervous tissue, branching repeatedly to end in slight enlargements on the pia mater.\n",
            "Thus, neuroglia is evidently a connective tissue in function but is not so in development; it is ectodermal in origin, whereas all connective tissues are mesodermal.\n",
            "In the gray substance of the brain and medulla spinalis, but smaller collections of these cells also form the swellings, known as ganglia, seen on many nerves.\n",
            "These latter are found chiefly upon the spinal and cranial nerve roots and in connection with the sympathetic nerves.\n",
            "There are different shape and size of nerve cells and have one or more processes.\n",
            "They may be divided for purposes of description into three groups, according to the number of processes which they possess:\n",
            "(1) Unipolar cells are found in the spinal ganglia; the single process, after a short course, divides in a T-shaped manner Bipolar cells are also found in the spinal ganglia when the cells are in an embryonic condition.\n",
            "They are best demonstrated in the spinal ganglia of fish.\n",
            "Sometimes the processes come off from opposite poles of the cell, and the cell then assumes a spindle shape; in other cells both processes emerge at the same point.\n",
            "In some cases where two fibers are explicity connected with a cell, one of the fibers is really derived from an adjoining nerve cell and is passing to end in a ramification around the ganglion cell, or, again, it may be coiled spirally around the nerve process which is issuing from the cell.\n",
            "(3) Multipolar cells has pyramidal or stellate shape, and characterized by their large size and by the numerous processes which issue from them.\n",
            "The processes are of two types: one of them is termed the axis-cylinder process or axon because it becomes the axis-cylinder of a nerve fiber.\n",
            "The others are termed the protoplasmic processes or dendrons; they start to divide and subdivide soon after they emerge from the cell, and finally end in minute twigs and become lost among the other elements of the nervous tissue.\n",

            "Beyond the nodes termed Frommann’s lines there may also be seen transverse lines; the significance of these is not understood.\n",
            "In addition to these interruptions oblique clefts may be seen in the medullary sheath, subdividing it into irregular portions, which are termed medullary segments, or segments of Lantermann; there is reason to believe that these clefts are artificially produced in the preparation of the specimens.\n",

            "a.Two medullated nerve fibers among a number of gray nerve fibers, b. Medullated nerve fibers, when examined in the fresh condition, frequently present a beaded or varicose appearance: this is due to manipulation and pressure causing the oily matter to collect into drops, and as result of the extreme delicacy of the primitive sheath, even slight pressure will cause the transudation of the fatty matter, which collects as drops of oil outside the membrane.\n",
            "The neurolemma or primitive sheath is a delicate, structureless membrane.\n",
            "Here and there beneath it, and situated in depressions in the white matter of Schwann, are nuclei surrounded by a small amount of protoplasm.\n",
            "The nuclei is shape are oval and somewhat flattened, and bear a definite relation to the nodes of Ranvier, one nucleus generally lying in the center of each internode.\n",
            "In all medullated nerve fibers the primitive sheath is not present, being absent in those fibers which are found in the brain and medulla spinalis.\n",
            "If nerver fibres are cut across its central ends degenerate as far as the first node of Ranvier; but the peripheral ends degenerate\n",
            "simultaneously throughout their whole length.\n",
            "The axons break up into fragments and become surrounded by drops of fatty substance which are formed from the breaking down of the medullary sheath.\n",
            "The nuclei of the primitive sheath proliferate, and finally absorption of the axons and fatty substance occurs.\n",
            "If the cut ends of the nerve be sutured together regeneration of the nerve fibers takes place by the downgrowth of axons from the central end of the nerve.\n",
            "At one time it was believed that the regeneration was peripheral in origin, but this has been disproved, the proliferated nuclei in the peripheral portions taking part merely in the formation of the so-called scaffolding along which the new axons pass.\n",
            "Most of the fibers of the sympathetic system, and some of the cerebrospinal, consist of the gray or gelatinous nerve fibers (fibers of Remak).\n",
            "Each of these consists of an axis-cylinder to which nuclei are applied at intervals.\n",
            "These nuclei are believed to be in connection with a delicate sheath similar the neurolemma of the medullated nerve fiber.\n",
            "In external appearance the non-medullated nerve fibers are semitransparent and gray or yellowish gray.\n",
            "The individual fibers vary in size, generally averaging about half the size of the medullated fibers.\n",
            "As far as the cerebrospinal nerves is concerned it consist of numerous nerve fibers collected together and enclosed in membranous sheaths.\n",
            "A small bundle of fibers, enclosed in a tubular sheath, is called a funiculus; if the nerve is of small size, it may consist only of a single funiculus; but if large, the funiculi are collected together into larger bundles or fasciculi, which are bound together in a common membranous investment.\n",
            "In structure the common membranous investment, or sheath of the whole nerve (epineurium), as well as the septa given off from it to separate the fasciculi, consist of connective tissue, composed of white and yellow elastic fibers, the latter existing in great abundance.\n",
            "The tubular sheath of the funiculi (perineurium) is a fine, smooth, transparent membrane, which may be easily separated, in the form of a tube, from the fibers it encloses; in structure it is made up of connective tissue, which has a distinctly lamellar arrangement.\n",
            "The nerve fibers are held together and supported within the funiculus by delicate connective tissue, called the endoneurium.\n",
            "It is continuous with septa which pass inward from the innermost layer of the perineurium, and shows a ground substance in which are imbedded fine bundles of fibrous connective tissue running for the most part longitudinally.\n",
            "It serves to support capillary vessels, arranged so as to form a net-work with elongated meshes.\n",
            "The cerebrospinal nerves consist almost exclusively of medullated nerve fibers, only a very small proportion of nonmedullated being present.\n",
            "The bloodvessels supplying a nerve end in a minute capillary plexus, the vessels composing which pierce the perineurium, and run, for the most part, parallel with the fibers; they are connected together by short, transverse vessels, forming narrow, oblong meshes, corresponding to the capillary system of muscle.\n",
            "Fine non-medullated nerve fibers, vasomotor fibers, accompany these capillary vessels, and break up into elementary fibrils, which form a network around the vessels.\n",
            "Horsley has demonstrated certain medullated fibers running in the epineurium and terminating in small spheroidal tactile corpuscles or end bulbs of Krause.\n",
            "These nerve fibers, which Marshall believes to be sensory, and which he has termed nervi nervorum, are considered by him to have a significant bearing upon certain neuralgic pains.\n",
            "The nerve fibers, so far as is at present known, do not coalesce, but pursue an uninterrupted course from the center to the periphery.\n",
            "In separating a nerve, however, into its component funiculi, it may be seen that these do not pursue a perfectly insulated course, but occasionally join at a very acute angle with other funiculi proceeding in the same direction; from this, branches are given off, to joint again in like manner with other funiculi.\n",
            "It must be distinctly understood, however, that in these communications the individual nerve fibers do not coalesce, but only pass into the sheath of the adjacent nerve, become intermixed with its nerve fibers, and again pass on to intermingle with the nerve fibers in some adjoining funiculus.\n",
            "Nerves, in their course, subdivide into branches, and these frequently communicate with branches of a neighboring nerve.\n",
            "The communications which thus take place form what is called a plexus.\n",
            "Sometimes a plexus is formed by the primary branches of the trunks of the nerves—as the cervical, brachial, lumbar, and sacral plexuses—and occasionally by the terminal funiculi, as in the plexuses formed at the periphery of the body.\n",
            "In the formation of a plexus, the component nerves divide, then join, and again subdivide in such a complex manner that the individual funiculi become interlaced most intricate’y; so that each branch leaving a plexus may contain filaments from all the primary nervous trunks which form the plexus.\n",
            "In the formation also of smaller plexuses at the periphery of the body there is a free interchange of the funiculi and primitive fibers.\n",
            "In each case, however, the individual fibers remain separate and distinct.\n",
            "Fig. : Diagram of Transverse section of human tibial nerve.\n",
            "There is a possibility that through this interchange of fibers, every branch passing off from a plexus has a more extensive connection with the spinal cord than if it had proceeded to its distribution without forming connections with other nerves.\n",
            "Resultant by the parts supplied by these nerves have more extended relations with the nervous centers; by this means, also, groups of muscles may be associated for combined action.\n",
            "Very similar to cerebrospinal nerves the sympathetic nerves are constructed, but consist mainly of non-medullated fibers, collected in funiculi and enclosed in sheaths of connective tissue.\n",
            "There is, however, in these nerves a certain admixture of medullated fibers.\n",
            "The number of the latter varies in different nerves, and may be estimated by the color of the nerve.\n",
            "Those branches of the sympathetic, which present a wellmarked gray color, are composed chiefly of non-medullated nerve fibers, intermixed with a few medullated fibers; while those of a white color contain many of the latter fibers, and few of the former.\n",
            "Separate and diverse impressions are conveyed by the cerebrospinal and sympathetic nerve fibers.\n",
            "The sensory nerves, called also centripetal or afferent nerves, transmit to the nervous centers impressions made upon the peripheral extremities of the nerves, and in this way the mind, through the medium of the brain, becomes conscious of external objects.\n",
            "The centrifugal or efferent nerves transmit impressions from the nervous centers to the parts to which the nerves are distributed, these impressions either exciting muscular contraction or influencing the processes of nutrition, growth, and secretion.\n",
            "By the expression “the terminations of nerve fibers” is signified their connections with the nerve centers and with the parts they supply.\n",
            "The former are sometimes called their origins or central terminations; the latter their peripheral terminations.\n",
            "In few cases the origin of nerves is single—that is to say, the whole nerve emerges from the nervous center by a single root; in\n",
            "other instances the nerve arises by two or more roots which come off from various parts of the nerve center, sometimes widely apart from each other, and it often happens, when a nerve arises in this way by two roots, that the functions of these two roots are different; as, for example, in the spinal nerves, each of which arises by two roots, the anterior of which is motor, and the posterior sensory.\n",
            "The point where the nerve root or roots emerge from the surface of the nervous center is named the superficial orapparent origin, but the fibers of the nerve can be traced for a certain distance into the substance of the nervous center to some portion of the gray matter, which constitutes the deep or real origin of the nerve.\n",
            "The centrifugal or efferent nerve fibers originate in the nerve cells of the gray substance, the axis-cylinder processes of these cells being prolonged to form the fibers.\n",
            "In the case of the centripetal or afferent nerves the fibers grow inward either from nerve cells in the organs of special sense, e. g.,the retina, or from nerve cells in the ganglia.\n",
            "Having entered the nerve center they branch and send their ultimate twigs among the cells, without, however, uniting with them.\n",
            "In various ways nerve fibers terminate peripherally, and these may be conveniently studied in the sensory and motor nerves respectively.\n",
            "The terminations of the sensory nerves are dealt with in the section on Sense Organs.\n",
            "Motor nerves can be traced into either unstriped or striped muscular fibers.\n",
            "In the unstriped or involuntary muscles the nerves are derived from the sympathetic, and are composed mainly of non-medullated fibers.\n",
            "Near their terminations they divide into numerous branches, which communicate and form intimate plexuses.\n",
            "At the junction of the branches small triangular nuclear bodies (ganglion cells) are situated.\n",
            "From these plexuses minute branches are given off which divide and break up into the ultimate fibrillæ of which the nerves are composed.\n",
            "These fibrillæ course between the involuntary muscle cells, and, according to Elischer, terminate on the surfaces of the cells, opposite the nuclei, in minute swellings.\n",
            "In the striped or voluntary muscle the nerves supplying the muscular fibers are derived from the cerebrospinal nerves, and are composed mainly of medullated fibers.\n",
            "The nerve, after entering the sheath of the muscle, breaks up into fibers or bundles of fibers, which form plexuses, and gradually divide until, as a rule, a single nerve fiber enters a single muscular fiber.\n",
            "Sometimes, however, if the muscular fiber be long, more than one nerve fiber enters it.\n",
            "Within the muscular fiber the nerve terminates in a special expansion, called by Kühne, who first accurately described it, a motor end-plate.\n",
            "On approaching the muscular fiber.\n",
            "The nerve fiber suddenly loses its medullary sheath, the neurolemma becomes continuous with the sarcolemma of the muscle, and only the axis-cylinder enters the muscular fiber.\n",
            "There it at once spreads out, ramifying like the roots of a tree, immediately beneath the sarcolemma, and becomes imbedded in a layer of granular matter, containing a number of clear, oblong nuclei, the whole constituting an endplate from which the contractile wave of the muscular fiber is said to start.\n",
            "Ganglia which are small aggregations of nerve cells found on the posterior roots of the spinal nerves; on the sensory roots of the trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves, and on the acoustic nerves.\n",
            "They are also found in connection with the sympathetic nerves.\n",
            "On section they are seen to consist of a reddishgray substance, traversed by numerous white nerve fibers; they vary considerably in form and size; the largest are found in the cavity of the abdomen; the smallest, not visible to the naked eye, exist in considerable numbers upon the nerves distributed to the different viscera.\n",
            "Each ganglion is invested by a smooth and firm, closely adhering, membranous envelope, consisting of dense areolar tissue;\n",
            "this sheath is continuous with the perineurium of the nerves, and sends numerous processes into the interior to support the bloodvessels supplying the substance of the ganglion.\n",

            "Each nerve cell has a nucleated sheath which is continuous with the neurolemma of the nerve fiber with which the cell is connected.\n",
            "The nerve cells in the ganglia of the spinal nerves are pyriform in shape, and have each a single process.\n",
            "A small distance from the cell and while still within the ganglion this process divides in a T-shaped manner, one limb of the cross-bar turning into the medulla spinalis, the other limb passing outward to the periphery.\n",
            "In the sympathetic ganglia the nerve cells are multipolar and each has one axis-cylinder process and several dendrons; the axon emerges from the ganglion as a non-medullated nerve fiber.\n",
            "Similar cells are found in the ganglia connected with the trigeminal nerve, and these ganglia are therefore regarded as the cranial portions of the sympathetic system.\n",
            "The sympathetic nervous system comprises those portions of the nervous mechanism in which a medullated nerve fiber from the central system passes to a ganglion, sympathetic or peripheral, from which fibers, usually non-medullated, are distributed to such structures, e. g., bloodvessels, as are not under voluntary control.\n",

            "In the spinal ganglia the nerve cells are much larger and for the most part collected in groups near the periphery, while the fibers, which are mostly medullated, traverse the central portion of the ganglion; whereas in the sympathetic ganglia the cells are smaller and distributed in irregular groups throughout the whole ganglion; the fibers also are irregularly scattered; some of the entering ones are medullated, while many of those leaving the ganglion are non-medullated.\n",
            "The nerve cell and its processes collectively constitute what is termed a neuron, and Waldeyer propounded a theory that said that the nervous system is built up of numerous neurons, “anatomically and genetically independent of one another.”\n",
            "For this theory (neuron theory) the processes of one neuron only come into contact, and are never in direct continuity, with those of other neurons; while impulses are transmitted from one nerve cell to another through these points of contact, the synapses.\n",
            "The synapse or synaptic membrane appear to allow nervous impulses to pass in one direction only, namely, from the terminals of the axiscylinder to the dendrons.\n",
            "This theory is based on the following facts, such as:\n",
            "(1) embryonic nerve cells or neuroblasts are completely different from one another;\n",
            "(2) when nervous tissues are stained by the Golgi method no continuity is seen even between neighboring neurons; and\n",
            "(3) when degenerative changes take place in nervous tissue, either as the result of disease or experiment, they never spread from one neuron to another, but are limited to the individual neurons, or groups of neurons, primarily affected.\n",
            "However, it must be added that within the past few years the validity of the neuron theory has been called in question by certain eminent histologists, who maintain that by the employment of more delicate histological methods, minute fibrils can be followed from one nerve cell into another.\n",
            "Their existence, however, in the living is open to question.\n",
            "Mott and Marinesco made careful examinations of living cells, using even the ultramicroscope and agree that neither Nissl bodies nor neurofibrils are present in the living state.\n",
            "For the present we may look upon the neurons as the units or structural elements of the nervous system.\n",
            "At birth all the neurons are present which are present in the adult, their division ceases before birth; they are not all functionally active at birth, but gradually assume functional activity.\n",
            "There is no indication of any regeneration after the destruction of the cell-body of any individual neuron.\n",
            "Fasciculi, tracts or fiber systems are groups of axons having homologous origin and homologous distribution (as regards their collaterals, subdivisions and terminals) and are often named in accordance with their origin and termination, the name of the nucleus or the location of the cell body from which the axon or fiber arises preceding that of the nucleus or location of its termination.\n",

            "The next major development in neuroanatomy came from the Greek Alcmaeon, who determined that the brain and not the heart ruled the body and that the senses were dependent on the brain.\n",
            "After Alcmaeon’s findings, many scientists, philosophers, and physicians from around the world continued to contribute to the understanding of neuroanatomy, notably: Galen, Herophilus, Rhazes and Erasistratus.\n",
            "Herophilus and Erasistratus of Alexandria were perhaps the most influential Greek neuroscientists with their studies involving dissecting the brains.\n",
            "For several hundred years afterward, with the cultural taboo of dissection, no major progress\n",
            "occurred in neuroscience.\n",
            "However, Pope Sixtus IV effectively revitalized the study of neuroanatomy by altering the papal policy and allowing human dissection.\n",

            "In 1664, Thomas Willis, a physician and professor at Oxford University, coined the term neurology when he published his text Cerebri anatome which is considered the foundation of neuroanatomy.The subsequent three hundred and fifty some years has produced a great deal of documentation and study of the neural systems.\n",
            "At the tissue level, the nervous system is composed of neurons, glial cells, and extracellular matrix.\n",
            "Both neurons and glial cells come in many types.\n",
            "Neurons are the information-processing cells of the nervous system: they sense our environment, communicate with each other via electrical signals and chemicals called neurotransmitters across synapses, and produce our memories, thoughts and movements.\n",
            "Glial cells maintain homeostasis, produce myelin, and provide support and protection for the brain’s neurons.\n",
            "Some glial cells (astrocytes) can even propagate intercellular calcium waves over long distances in response to stimulation, and release gliotransmitters in response to changes in calcium concentration.\n",
            "The extracellular matrix also provides support on the molecular level for the brain’s cells.\n",
            "At the organ level, the nervous system is composed of brain regions, such as the hippocampus in mammals or the mushroom bodies of thefruit fly.\n",
            "These regions are often modular and serve a particular role within the general pathways of the nervous system.\n",
            "For instance, the hippocampus is critical for forming memories.\n",
            "The nervous system also contains nerves, which are bundles of fibers that originate from the brain and spinal cord, and branch repeatedly to innervate every part of the body.\n",
            "Nerves are made mainly of the axons of neurons, along with a variety of membranes that wrap around and segregate them into nerve fascicles.\n",
            "The vertebrate nervous system can be divided into the central and peripheral nervous systems.\n",
            "The central nervous system (CNS) consists of the brain, retina, and spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is made up of all the nerves outside of the CNS that connect it to the rest of the body.\n",
            "The PNS is further subdivided into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems.\n",
            "The somatic nervous system is made up of “afferent” neurons, which bring sensory information from the sense organs to the CNS, and “efferent” neurons, which carry motor instructions out to the muscles.\n",
            "The autonomic nervous system also has two subdivisions, the sympathetic and theparasympathetic, which are important for regulating the body’s basic internal organ functions like heartbeat, breathing, digestion, and salivation.\n",
            "Autonomic nerves, like somatic nerves, contain afferent and efferent fibers.\n",
            "In anatomy in general and neuroanatomy in particular, many sets of topographic terms are used to denote orientation and location, which are generally referred to the body or brain axis.\n",
            "The pairs of terms used most commonly in neuroanatomy are as under:\n",
            "• Dorsal and ventral: dorsal loosely meant the top or upper side, and ventral to the bottom or lower side.\n",
            "These descriptors originally referred to dorsum and ventrum back and belly- of the body; the belly of most animals is oriented towards the ground; the erect posture of humans places our ventral aspect anteriorly, and the dorsal aspect becomes posterior.\n",
            "The case of the head and the brain is peculiar, since the belly does not extend into the head properly, unless we assume that the mouth represents an extended belly element.\n",
            "• Therefore, in common use, those brain parts that lie close to the base of the cranium, and through it to the mouth\n",
            "cavity, are known as ventral -i.e., at its bottom or lower side, as defined above)-, whereas dorsal parts are closer to the enclosing cranial vault.\n",
            "• Rostral and caudal: rostral refers to the front of the body (towards the nose, or rostrum in Latin), andcaudal to the tail end of the body (towards the tail; cauda in Latin).\n",
            "In Man, the directional terms “superior” and “inferior” inevitably refer to this rostrocaudal dimension, because our body axis is roughly oriented vertically in the erect position.\n",
            "However, all vertebrates develop a kink in the neural tube that is still detectable in the adult central nervous system, known as the cephalic flexure.\n",
            "The latter bends the rostral part of the CNS at a 90 degree angle relative to the caudal part, at the transition between the forebrain and the brainstem and spinal cord.\n",
            "This change in axial dimension is problematic when trying to describe relative position and sectioning planes in the brain.\n",
            "• Medial and lateral: medial refers to being close, or relatively closer, to the midline (the descriptor median means a position precisely at the midline. Lateral is the opposite (a position separated away from the midline).\n",
            "Note that such descriptors (dorsal/ventral, rostral/caudal; medial/lateral) are relative rather than absolute (e.g., a lateral structure may be said to lie medial to something else that lies even more laterally).\n",
            "For planes of orientation or planes of section in neuroanatomy commonly used terms are “sagittal”, “transverse” or “coronal”, and “axial” or “horizontal”.\n",
            "Again in this case, the situation is different for swimming, creeping or cuadrupedal (prone) animals than for Man, or other erect species, due to the changed position of the axis.\n",
            "• By mid-sagittal plane the body and brain are divided into left and right halves; sagittal sections in general are parallel to this median plane, moving along the medial-lateral dimension.\n",
            "The term sagittal implies etymologically to the median suture between the right and left parietal bones of the cranium, known classically as sagittal suture, as it looks roughly like an arrow by its confluence with other sutures (sagitta; arrow in Latin).\n",
            "• A section plane across any elongated form in principle is held to be transverse if it is orthogonal to the axis (e.g., a transverse section of a finger; if there is no length axis, there is no way to define such sections, or there are infinite possibilities).\n",
            "Therefore, transverse body sections in vertebrates are parallel to the ribs, which are orthogonal to the vertebral column, that represents the body axis both in animals and man.\n",
            "• The brain also has an intrinsic longitudinal axis -that of the primordial elongated neural tube-, which becomes largely vertical with the erect posture of Man, similarly as the body axis, except at its rostral end, as commented above.\n",
            "This explains that transverse spinal cord sections are roughly parallel to our ribs, or to the ground.\n",
            "However, this is only true for the spinal cord and the brainstem, since the forebrain end of the neural axis bends crook-like during early morphogenesis into the hypothalamus, where it ends; the orientation of true transverse sections accordingly changes, and is no longer parallel to the ribs and ground, but perpendicular to them; lack of awareness of this morphologic brain peculiarity (present in all vertebrate brains without exceptions) has caused and still causes erroneous thinking on forebrain brain parts.\n",
            "• Acknowledging the singularity of rostral transverse sections, tradition has introduced a different descriptor for them, namely coronal sections.\n",
            "Coronal sections divide the forebrain from rostral (front) to caudal (back), forming a series orthogonal (transverse) to the local bent axis.\n",
            "The concept cannot be applied meaningfully to the brainstem and spinal cord, since there the coronal sections become horizontal to the axial dimension, being parallel to the axis.\n",
            "• Across the head and brain a coronal plane is modernly conceived to be parallel to the face (the etymology refers\n",
            "to corona or crown; the plane in which a king’s crown sits on his head is not exactly parallel to the face, and exportation of the concept to less frontally endowed animals than us is obviously even more conflictive, but there is an implicit reference to the coronal suture of the cranium, which forms between the frontal and temporal/parietal bones, giving a sort of diadema configuration which is roughly parallel to the face).\n",
            "Coronal section planes thus essentially refer only to the head and brain, where a diadema makes sense, and not to the neck and body below.\n",
            "• By definition horizontal sections are aligned with the horizon.\n",
            "In swimming, creeping and cuadrupedal animals the body axis itself is horizontal, and, thus, horizontal sections run along the length of the spinal cord, separating ventral from dorsal parts.\n",
            "Horizontal sections are orthogonal to both transverse and sagittal sections.\n",
            "Owing to the axial bend in the brain (forebrain), true horizontal sections in that region are orthogonal to coronal (transverse) sections (as is the horizon relative to the face).\n",
            "According to these considerations, the three directions of space are represented precisely by the sagittal, transverse and horizontal planes, whereas coronal sections can be transverse, oblique or horizontal, depending on how they relate to the brain axis and its incurvations.\n",
            "In neuroanatomy modern developments are directly correlated to the technologies used to perform research.\n",
            "Therefore it is necessary to discuss the various tools that are available.\n",
            "Several of the histological techniques used to study other tissues can be applied to the nervous system as well.\n",
            "However, there are some techniques that have been developed especially for the study of neuroanatomy.\n",
            "Under biological systems, cell staining is a technique used to enhance the contrast of particular features in microscopic images.\n",
            "Nissl staining uses aniline basic dyes to intensely stain the acidic polyribosomes in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, which is abundant in neurons.\n",
            "This permits researchers to distinguish between different cell types (such as neurons and glia), and neuronal shapes and sizes, in various regions of the nervous system cytoarchitecture.\n",
            "To fill selectively with a silver chromate precipitate a few neural cells (neurons or glia, but in principle any cells can react similarly) the classic Golgi stain uses potassium dichromate and silver nitrate.\n",
            "This so-called silver chromate impregnation procedure stains entirely or partially the cell bodies and neurites of some neurons -dendrites, axon- in brown and black, allowing researchers to trace their paths up to their thinnest terminal branches in a slice of nervous tissue, thanks to the transparency consequent to the lack of staining in the majority of surrounding cells.\n",
            "Modernly, Golgi-impregnated material has been adapted for electron-microscopic visualization of the unstained elements surrounding the stained processes and cell bodies, thus adding further resolutive power.\n",
            "Histochemistry uses knowledge about biochemical reaction properties of the chemical constituents of the brain (comprising notably enzymes) to apply selective methods of reaction to visualize where they occur in the brain and any functional or pathological changes.\n",
            "This applies importantly to molecules related to neurotransmitter production and metabolism, but applies likewise in many other directions chemoarchitecture, or chemical neuroanatomy.\n",
            "It is a special case of histochemistry that uses selective antibodies against a variety of chemical epitopes of the nervous system to selectively stain particular cell types, axonal fascicles, neuropiles, glial processes or blood vessels, or specific\n",
            "intracytoplasmic or intranuclear proteins and other immunogenetic molecules, e.g., neurotransmitters.\n",
            "Immunoreacted transcription factor proteins reveal genomic readout in terms of translated protein.\n",
            "This very increases the capacity of researchers to distinguish between different cell types (such as neurons and glia) in different regions of the nervous system.\n",
            "In situ hybridization uses synthetic RNA probes that attach (hybridize) selectively to complementary mRNA transcripts of DNA exons in the cytoplasm, to visualize genomic readout, that is, distinguish active gene expression, in terms of mRNA rather than protein.\n",
            "This permits to identify histologically (in situ) the cells involved in the production of genetically-coded molecules, which often represent differentiation or functional traits, as well as the molecular boundaries separating distinct brain domains or cell populations.\n",
            "By expressing variable amounts of red, green, and blue fluorescent proteins in the brain, the so-called “brainbow” mutant mouse permits the combinatorial visualization of various different colors in neurons.\n",
            "This tags neurons with enough unique colors that they can often be distinguished from their neighbours with fluorescence microscopy, enabling researchers to map the local connections or mutual arrangement (tiling) between neurons.\n",
            "Optogenetics uses transgenic constitutive and site-specific expression (normally in mice) of blocked markers that can be activated selectively by illumination with a light beam.\n",
            "This permits researchers to study axonal connectivity in the nervous system in a very discriminative way.\n",
            "With a view to investigate brain structure and function noninvasively in healthy human subjects magnetic resonance imaging has been used extensively.\n",
            "An important example is diffusion tensor imaging, which relies on the restricted diffusion of water in tissue in order to produce axon images.\n",
            "In particular, water moves more quickly along the direction aligned with the axons, permitting the inference of their structure.\n",
            "Some kind of viruses can replicate in brain cells and cross synapses.\n",
            "So, viruses modified to express markers (such as fluorescent proteins) can be brought to trace connectivity between brain regions across multiple synapses.\n",
            "Two tracer viruses which replicate and spread transneuronal/transsynaptic are the Herpes simplex virus type1 (HSV) and the Rhabdoviruses.\n",
            "Herpes simplex virus was utilise to trace the connections between the brain and the stomach, in order to examine the brain areas involved in viscero-sensory processing.\n",
            "Another study injected herpes simplex virus into the eye, thus allowing the visualization of the optical pathway from the retina into the visual system.\n",
            "An instance of a tracer virus which replicates from the synapse to the soma is the pseudorabies virus.\n",
            "By using pseudorabies viruses with different fluorescent reporters, dual infection models can parse complex synaptic architecture.\n",
            "Various types of dyes (horseradish peroxidase variants, fluorescent or radioactive markers, lectins, dextrans) are used by Axonal transport methods that are more or less avidly absorbed by neurons or their processes.\n",
            "These molecules are selectively transported anterogradely (from soma to axon terminals) or retrogradely (from axon terminals to soma), thus providing evidence of primary and collateral connections in the brain.\n",
            "These ‘physiologic’ methods (because properties of living, unlesioned cells are used) can be combined with other procedures, and have essentially superseded the earlier procedures studying degeneration of lesioned neurons or axons.\n",

            "From the human brain, there are several other animals whose brains and nervous systems have received extensive study as model systems, comprising mice, zebrafish, fruit fly, and a species of roundworm called C. elegans.\n",
            "Each of these has its own advantages and disadvantages as a model system.\n",
            "For instance, the C. elegans nervous system is extremely stereotyped from one individual worm to the next.\n",
            "This has permitted researchers using electron microscopy to map the paths and connections of all of the approximately 300 neurons in this species.\n",
            "The fruit fly is widely studied in part because its genetics is very well understood and easily manipulated.\n",
            "The mouse is used since, as a mammal, its brain is more similar in structure to our own (e.g., it has a sixlayered cortex, yet its genes can be easily modified and its reproductive cycle is relatively fast.\n",
            "The brain is small and simple in some species, like the nematode worm, where the body plan is quite simple: a tube with a hollow gut cavity running from the mouth to the anus, and a nerve cord with an enlargement (a ganglion) for each body segment, with an especially large ganglion at the front, known as the brain.\n",
            "The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been studied because of its importance in genetics.\n",
            "In the early 1970s, Sydney Brenner chose it as a model system for studying the way that genes control development, including neuronal development.\n",
            "One advantage of working with this worm is that the nervous system of the hermaphrodite contains exactly 302 neurons, always in the same places, making corresponding synaptic connections in every worm.\n",
            "Brenner’s team sliced worms into thousands of ultrathin sections and photographed every section under an electron microscope, then visually matched fibers from section to section, to map out every neuron and synapse in the entire body, to give a complete connectome of the nematode.\n",

            "The first understanding of biological processes requiring the Rab23 gene came from 2 independent mouse mutations in the gene and an epistasis analysis with mutations in the mouse shh gene.\n",
            "These studies exhibits that the gene is required for normal development of the brain and spinal cord and that the morphological defects seen in mutant embryos, such as failure to close dorsal regions of the neural tube during development, appeared secondary to expansion of ventral and reduction of dorsal identities in the developing neural tube.\n",

            "Though a complete discussion of neuroanatomy is worthy of a thick textbook full of elaborate illustrations, common terminology used in neuroscientific research is highlighted below.\n",
            "The brain perched on top of the spinal column is the epicenter of the human nervous system.\n",
            "It is the largest part of the central nervous system (CNS) and made up of three general areas: the brain stem, the cerebellum, and the cerebral cortex.\n",
            "The brain stem is involved with autonomic control of processes such as breathing and heart rate as well as conduction of information to and from the peripheral nervous system, the nerves and ganglia found outside the brain and spinal cord.\n",
            "The cerebellum, adjacent to the brain stem, is accountable for balance and coordination of movement.\n",
            "Resting above these structures, the cerebral cortex quickly perceives, analyzes, and responds to information from the world around us.\n",
            "It handles sensory perception and processing as well as higher-level cognitive functions such as perception, memory, and decision-making.\n",
            "These three areas work together seamlessly in healthy individuals, allowing the brain to coordinate necessary functions and behaviors from breathing to spatial navigation.\n",
            "The cerebral cortex is divided into two hemispheres connected by the corpus callosum, a bridge of wide, flat neural fibers that act as communication relays between the two sides.\n",
            "While many popular books suggest this lateralization is important to function (i.e., the right side of the brain is the creative side while the left hemisphere dabbles more in analytical processing), most cognitive processes are represented by activation on both hemispheres.\n",
            "The exception is language—both Broca’s Area, an area important to language syntax, and Wernicke’s Area, a region critical to language content, reside on the left side of the\n",
            "brain.\n",
            "Otherwise, the two hemispheres are nearly symmetrical and each one is further subdivided into four major lobes: the occipital, the temporal, the parietal, and the frontal.\n",
            "These lobes are mainly used to denote general anatomical location.\n",
            "But they are also frequently spoken about in terms of function.\n",
            "The occipital lobe, located at the back of the brain, is the seat of the primary visual cortex, the brain region responsible for processing and interpreting visual information.\n",
            "Reaching from the temple back towards the occipital lobe, the temporal lobe is a major processing center for language and memory.\n",
            "Above the temporal lobe and adjacent to the occipital lobe, the parietal lobe houses the somatosensory cortex and plays an important role in touch and spatial navigation.\n",
            "Lastly, the frontal lobe, extending from behind the forehead back to the parietal lobe, is the brain region that separates humans from our primate cousins.\n",
            "This large brain lobe is the seat of so-called executive function, with a hand in reasoning, decision-making, integration of sensory information, and the planning and execution of movement.\n",
            "The cortex is, at its most basic, an extended pane of neural tissue that is gathered and pleated to fit inside the skull cavity.\n",
            "The bump in each pleat is called the gyrus, while the groove made by the fold is known as the sulcus.\n",
            "No two human brains are folded in the same exact way.\n",
            "Yet several of these folds are large and pronounced enough to merit specific names.\n",
            "They are used to specify location—but also may be referred to in discussions of function.\n",
            "For instance, the lateral sulcus is the inner fold that separates the temporal lobe from the frontal lobe.\n",
            "Adjacent to the lateral sulcus is the temporal gyrus.\n",
            "Both this groove and fold house the primary auditory cortex, where the brain processes sound information.\n",
            "Wernicke’s area, a brain region critical to understand language, also resides on the temporal gyrus.\n",
            "Similarly, different studies may refer to specific activations in the superior frontal, middle frontal, and inferior frontal gyri in the frontal lobes.\n",
            "And, in studies of motor function, mentions of primary motor cortex may also refer to a location between the precentral gyrus and the central sulcus at the top of the brain.\n",
            "Contrary to popular lay-press usage, the terms lobe and gyrus are not interchangeable.\n",
            "References to gyri and sulci can help give a more specific location on a particular lobe of the cortex.\n",
            "Sometimes researchers refer to specific locations on the human brain by a number, or Brodmann area.\n",
            "Korbinian Brodmann was a German neurologist who studied the brain in the early part of the twentieth century.\n",
            "He created maps of the brain based on cytoarchitecture, or how the cells were functionally organized.\n",

            "Although Brodmann areas are frequently cited in neuroscientific literature, it is not the only classification system available.\n",
            "The same brain area may be referred to by different names depending on the study.\n",
            "For instance, neuroscientists who study visual perception may refer to primary visual cortex as V1, Brodmann area 17, or simply as part of the occipital cortex.\n",
            "Specific brain areas may also be denoted by Talairach coordinates, as defined by French neurosurgeon, Jean Talairach.\n",
            "Talairach used two key anatomical landmarks, the anterior commissure and the posterior commissure (parts of the corpus callosum) as the basis of his coordinate system.\n",
            "Today, several neuroimaging analysis programs spatially normalize the brains of each study participant to fit a standard reference brain based on Talairach’s original brain atlas.\n",
            "Neurons or brain cells, are made up of cell bodies, axons, and dendrites.\n",
            "The cells chiefly connect to one another through synapses\n",
            "(small junctions between brain cells where neurotransmitters and other neurochemicals are passed).\n",
            "Synapses are often found between the axons and dendrites, which allows the cells to signal to one another.\n",
            "Current estimates suggest the brain has approximately 86 billion neurons.\n",
            "The brain is made up of two types of matter: gray and white.\n",
            "Gray matter consists of the cell bodies and dendrites of the neurons, as well as supporting cells called astroglia and oligodendrocytes.\n",
            "White matter, however, is made up of mostly of axons sheathed in myelin, an insulating-type material that helps cells propagate signals more quickly.\n",
            "It’s the myelin that gives the white matter its lighter color.\n",
            "For many years, neuroscientists believed white matter was simply a support resource for gray matter.\n",
            "However, recent studies show that white matter architecture is important in processes like learning and memory.\n",
            "The frontal lobes are often referred to as the neocortex as they are the most recent parts of the brain to evolve—and their size and structure is unique to humans.\n",
            "But the neocortex works closely in concert with areas of the so-called reptilian brain, or subcortical brain areas residing close to the brain stem, to help us make sense of the world around us.\n",
            "Subcortical structures like the thalamus and basal ganglia (responsible for integrating sensory information and processing risk and rewards, respectively) are strongly connected to the neocortex and share information in both a bottomup and top-down fashion.\n",
            "In fact, modern neuroimaging research is no longer focused on functional segregation, or the localization of function to a single area.\n",
            "Today, researchers are using new techniques to follow tracts of neurons that connect networks of brain areas to better understand how they work together to determine human behavior.\n",

            "Symptoms may comprise impaired memory, perception, cognition or emotional state.\n",
            "Because neuroendocrinology and behavioural neurology patients often share the same symptoms, finding the underlying basis for a disorder is key to managing it correctly.\n",
            "Many doctors fail to recognize this overlap between hormones and brain function, leading to incorrect diagnoses.\n",
            "Neuropsychiatry and Behavioural Neurology are disciplines among the clinical neurosciences that focus on the clinical and pathological aspects of neural processes associated with cognition, emotion, and behaviour.\n",
            "Current advances in structural and functional brain imaging, clinical electrophysiology, and experimental psychology fostered unprecedented growth in the clinical neurosciences, and have enlightened our understanding of both normal and disturbed\n",

            "Agraphia is an acquired neurological disorder causing a loss in the ability to communicate through writing, either due to some form of motor dysfunction or an inability to spell.\n",
            "The loss of writing ability may present with other language or neurological disorders; disorders appearing commonly with agraphia are alexia, aphasia, dysarthria,agnosia, and apraxia.\n",
            "The study of individuals with agraphia may provide more information about the pathways involved in writing, both language related and motoric.Agraphia cannot be directly treated, but individuals can learn techniques to help regain and rehabilitate some of their previous writing abilities.\n",
            "These techniques differ depending on the type of agraphia.\n",
            "Agraphia can be broadly divided into central and peripheral categories.\n",
            "Central agraphias typically involve language areas of the brain, causing difficulty spelling or with spontaneous communication, and are often accompanied by other language disorders.\n",
            "Peripheral agraphias usually target motor and visuospatial skills besides language and tend to involve motoric areas of the brain, causing difficulty in the movements associated with writing.\n",
            "Central agraphia may also be called aphasic agraphia as it involves areas of the brain whose major functions are connected to language and writing; peripheral agraphia may also be called nonaphasic agraphia as it involves areas of the brain whose functions are not directly connected to language and writing (typically motor areas).\n",
            "The history of agraphia dates to the mid-fourteenth century, but it was not until the second half of the nineteenth century that it sparked significant clinical interest.\n",
            "Research in the twentieth century focused primary on aphasiology in patients with lesions from strokes.\n",
            "There are many brain areas which interact and which are responsible for various aspects of the ability to write.\n",

            "Presumably the parietal lobe constructs the written-word images (probably via interaction with Wernicke’s area) which and assists in converting these into graphemes.\n",
            "These motor-graphemes (or written word/letter images) are then transmitted to the left frontal convexity (i.e. Broca’s and Exner’s area) for grapheme conversion and motoric expression.\n",
            "It has also been proposed that there are at least two stages involved in the act of writing: a linguistic stage and a motor- expressive-praxic stage.\n",
            "The linguistic stage involves the encoding of auditory and visual information into syntactical-lexical units—the symbols for letters and written words.\n",
            "This is mediated through the angular gyrus which thus provides the linguistic rules which subserve writing.\n",
            "The motor stage is the final step in which the expression of graphemes is subserved.\n",
            "This stage is mediated presumably by Exner’s writing area (located in the left frontal convexity) in conjunction with the inferior parietal lobule.\n",
            "Because different regions of the brain contribute to the ability to write, damage to these different areas, therefore, affect different aspects of the ability to write.\n",
            "Thus, there are different subtypes of agaphia, depending on which areas of the brain have been damaged.\n",
            "These subtypes are referred to as Frontal Agraphia, Pure Agraphia, Alexic Agraphia, Apraxic Agraphia, and Spatial Agraphia.\n",
            "It is located within a small area along the lateral convexity of the left frontal lobe, and is adjacent to Broca’s expressive speech area, and the primary and secondary areas controlling the movement of the hand and fine finger movements.\n",
            "Exner’s area appears to be the final common pathway where linguistic impulses receive a final motoric stamp for the purposes of writing.\n",
            "That is, Exner’s area translates auditory-images transferred from the posterior language areas, into those motor impulses that will form written words and sentences.\n",
            "Exner’s area is very dependent on Broca’s area with which is maintains extensive interconnections.\n",
            "That is, Broca’s area also acts to organize impulses received from the posterior language zones and relays them to Exner’s area for the purposes of written expression.\n",
            "Lesions localized to the left frontal lobe and Exner’s and Broca’s area typically result in disturbances in the elementary motoric aspects of writing, i.e.\n",
            "Frontal Agraphia.\n",
            "Frontal lobe agraphia, however, is sometimes referred to as Pure Agraphia.\n",
            "On the other hand, pure Agraphia has also been attributed to left parietal lesions.\n",
            "The similarity in symptoms is probably due to the fact that the inferior parietal lobe (IPL) transmits auditory-motor impulses to Broca’s and Exner’s area, and assists in programing sensory-\n",
            "motor movements.\n",
            "Generally, with frontal agraphia, grapheme (letter) formation becomes labored, uncoordinated, and takes on a very sloppy appearance.\n",
            "Cursive handwriting is usually more disturbed than printing, as cursive handwriting requires additional fine motor control.\n",
            "Cursive handwriting is also acquired at a later age, and is thus more likely to be more severely disrupted than printing which is (comparatively) an older and more ingrained skill.\n",
            "With frontal agraphia, the ability to spell is often affected.\n",
            "Patient’s may not be able to spell correctly even if given block letters—particularly if the left IPL is also damaged.\n",
            "However, with frontal agraphia, primarily, it is the ability to properly form letters and words that is disrupted.\n",
            "Predominantly, with frontal lesions, and thus frontal agraphia, there is a disturbances in grapheme selection.\n",
            "That is, the wrong letters may be chosen, and the patient may seem to have “forgotten” how to form certain letters.\n",
            "They may write the wrong letter—which in turn makes it appear that they have forgotten how to spell.\n",
            "Those with frontal agraphia may also abnormally sequence or even add unnecessary letters when writing.\n",
            "In general, with a left frontal lesion, spelling and writing with both the right and left hand is severely affected, and the left hand may be even more profoundly affected.\n",
            "Patients with frontal agraphia, particularly if Broca’s area is damaged, are unable to write spontaneously or to dictation.\n",
            "Writing samples are contaminated with perseverations (such that they write the same letter over and over) or the addition of extra strokes to letters (e.g. such as when writing an “m”=mmm).\n",
            "Patients with frontal agraphia may be unable to even write their name.\n",
            "Pure agraphia is related to frontal lesions, but is most commonly secondary to damage involving the superior and inferior parietal lobe (IPL).\n",
            "The IPL sits and the junction of the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobe, and assimilates and integrates complex auditory, visual, motor and tactile sensations so as to form those multi-modal images and concepts which are integral to the comprehension and expression of human language.\n",
            "With IPL damage, patients have difficulty programming those movements necessary to form written words, such that there is a loss of the ability select, form, and express, in writing, words and sentences.\n",
            "Patients with pure (parietal lobe) agraphia frequently misspell words, and may insert the wrong letters or place them in the wrong order or sequence when attempting to write.\n",
            "In contrast, reading, oral speech and the ability to name objects or letters are generally unimpaired.\n",
            "Very commonly, pure agraphia is related to lesions involving the superior and mid parietal regions of the left hemisphere; areas, 5 and 7 (Basso, et al. 2008; Vignolo, 2003), and/or the inferior parietal region (Strub & Geschwind, 1983).\n",
            "Patients are unable to write because the area involved in organizing visual-letter organization (i.e. the inferior parietal lobe) is cut off from the region controlling hand movements in the frontal lobe (Strub & Geschwind, 1983).\n",
            "However, according to Vignolo (2003), the posterior superior left parietal lobule (area 7) is crucial for the sensorimotor linguistic integration needed for writing.\n",
            "It has also been argued that the sensory motor engrams necessary for the production and perception of written language are stored within the inferior parietal lobule of the left hemisphere.\n",
            "When this region is damaged, patients sometimes have difficulty forming letters due to an inability to access these engrams (Strub & Geschwind, 1983).\n",
            "Writing samples, therefore, are characterized by mispellings, letter ommissions, distortions, temporal-sequential misplacements, and inversions.\n",

            "Patients with alexic-agraphia have generally have difficulty with spelling, even when block letters are employed.\n",

            "(Marcie & Heilman, 1979).\n",
            "Often alexia-agraphia is due to a lesion involving the left inferior parietal lobule and angular gyrus (Benson & Geschwind, 1969; Hecaen & Kremin, 1977).\n",
            "Because alexic-agrahia is associated with parietal lesions, it is also referred to as parietal lobe alexia.\n",
            "That is, rather than referred to as alexic agraphia, as patients who cannot spell are unable to write appropriately by definition, this condition could simply be referred to as alexia.\n",
            "However, what distinguishes alexic agraphia from alexia, is the disturbance of motor control which is not characteristic of alexia per se.\n",
            "That is, alexia is a loss of the ability to read, and is not related to motor abnormalities, as is the case with agraphia and alexic-agraphia.\n",

            "Because the patient is also apraxic, the ability to make gestures or complex patterned movements becomes abnormal such as those involved in writing is also deficient.\n",
            "That is, the ability to correctly temporally sequence hand movements is affected which interferes with the ability to write.\n",
            "The patient no longer knows how to correctly hold or manipulate a pen, or how to move their hand when writing.\n",
            "However, if given block letters, or if asked to spell out loud, they may be able to spell correctly.\n",
            "Right cerebral injuries can secondarily disrupt writing skills becauses of to generalized spatial and constructional deficiencies.\n",
            "This is because the right half of the brain, although minimally involved in grammar and word selection, is dominant for almost all aspects of visual spatial functioning and orientation, including the ability to coordinate movements in space.\n",

            "In some cases the writing may be reduced to a scrawl.\n",
            "In addition, patients may write only on the right half of the paper such that as they write, the left hand margin becomes progressively larger and the right side smaller (Hecaen & Marie, 1974).\n",
            "That is, they ignore the left half of visual space including the left half of the page they are writing on.\n",

            "Additionally, some individuals with cerebellar lesions (more typically associated with non-apraxic motor dysfunction) develop apraxic agraphia.\n",
            "Apraxic agraphia without ideomotor apraxia may be caused by damage to either of the parietal lobes, the dominant frontal lobe, or to the dominant thalamus.\n",
            "Visuospatial agraphia typically has a right hemisphere pathology.\n",

            "The word dementia describes a set of symptoms that can include memory loss and difficulties with thinking, problem-solving or language.\n",
            "These symptoms occur when the brain is damaged by certain diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease.\n",
            "This factsheet\n",
            "describes the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, how it is diagnosed, and the factors that can put someone at risk of developing it.\n",
            "It also describes the treatments and support that are currently available.\n",
            "Alzheimer’s disease, named after the doctor who first described it (Alois Alzheimer), is a physical disease that affects the brain.\n",
            "During the course of the disease, proteins build up in the brain to form structures called ‘plaques’ and ‘tangles’.\n",
            "This leads to the loss of connections between nerve cells, and eventually to the death of nerve cells and loss of brain tissue.\n",
            "People with Alzheimer’s also have a shortage of some important chemicals in their brain.\n",
            "These chemical messengers help to transmit signals around the brain.\n",
            "When there is a shortage of them, the signals are not transmitted as effectively.\n",
            "Current treatments for Alzheimer’s disease can help boost the levels of chemical messengers in the brain, which can help with some of the symptoms.\n",
            "Alzheimer’s is a progressive disease.\n",
            "This means that gradually, over time, more parts of the brain are damaged.\n",
            "As this happens, more symptoms develop.\n",
            "They also become more severe.\n",
            "The symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease are generally mild to start with, but they get worse over time and start to interfere with daily life.\n",
            "There are some common symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, but it is significant to remember that everyone is unique.\n",
            "Two people with Alzheimer’s are unlikely to experience the condition in exactly the same way.\n",
            "For most people with Alzheimer’s, the earliest symptoms are memory lapses.\n",
            "In particular, they may have difficulty recalling recent events and learning new information.\n",
            "These symptoms occur because the early damage in Alzheimer’s is usually to a part of the brain called the hippocampus, which has a central role in day-to-day memory.\n",
            "Memory for life events that happened a long time ago is often unaffected in the early stages of the disease.\n",
            "Memory loss due to Alzheimer’s disease increasingly interferes with daily life as the condition progresses.\n",
            "The person may:\n",
            "• lose items (eg keys, glasses) around the house\n",
            "• struggle to find the right word in a conversation or forget someone’s name\n",

            "• forget appointments or anniversaries.\n",
            "Although memory difficulties are generally the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer’s, someone with the disease will also have – or go on to develop – problems with other aspects of thinking, reasoning, perception or communication.\n",
            "They might have difficulties with:\n",
            "• language – struggling to follow a conversation or repeating themselves\n",
            "• visuospatial skills – problems judging distance or seeing objects in three dimensions; navigating stairs or parking the car become much harder\n",
            "• concentrating, planning or organising – difficulties making decisions, solving problems or carrying out a sequence of tasks (eg cooking a meal)\n",
            "• orientation – becoming confused or losing track of the day or date.\n",
            "A person in the earlier stages of Alzheimer’s will often have changes in their mood.\n",
            "They may become anxious, irritable or depressed.\n",
            "Many people become withdrawn and lose interest in activities and hobbies.\n",
            "As Alzheimer’s progresses, problems with memory loss, communication, reasoning and orientation become more severe.\n",
            "The person will need more day-to-day support from those who care for them.\n",
            "Some people start to believe things that are untrue (delusions) or – less often – see or hear things which are not really there (hallucinations).\n",
            "Many people with Alzheimer’s also develop behaviours that seem unusual or out of character.\n",
            "These include agitation (eg restlessness or pacing), calling out, repeating the same question, disturbed sleep patterns or reacting aggressively.\n",
            "Such behaviours can be distressing or challenging for the person and their carer.\n",
            "They may require separate treatment and management to memory problems.\n",
            "In the later stages of Alzheimer’s disease someone may become much less aware of what is happening around them.\n",
            "They may have difficulties eating or walking without help, and become increasingly frail.\n",
            "Eventually, the person will need help with all their daily activities.\n",
            "How quickly Alzheimer’s disease progresses, and the life expectancy of someone with it, vary greatly.\n",
            "On average, people with Alzheimer’s disease live for eight to ten years after the first symptoms.\n",
            "However, this varies a lot, depending particularly on how old the person was when they first developed Alzheimer’s. For more information seefactsheet 458, The progression of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias andfactsheet 417, The later stages of dementia.\n",
            "An estimated 10 per cent of people with dementia have more than one type at the same time.\n",
            "This is called mixed dementia.\n",
            "The most common combination is Alzheimer’s disease with vascular dementia (caused by problems with the blood supply to the brain).\n",
            "The symptoms of this kind of mixed dementia are a mixture of the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia.\n",
            "In some people with Alzheimer’s disease the earliest symptoms are not memory loss.\n",
            "This is called atypical Alzheimer’s disease.\n",
            "The underlying damage (plaques and tangles) is the same, but the first part of the brain to be affected is not the hippocampus.\n",
            "Atypical Alzheimer’s disease is uncommon in those diagnosed when they are over 65.\n",
            "It accounts for around five per cent of all Alzheimer’s in this age group.\n",
            "It is, however, more common in people diagnosed when they are under 65 (early-onset Alzheimer’s disease).\n",
            "In this age group it represents up to one-third of cases.\n",
            "The atypical forms of Alzheimer’s disease are as under:\n",
            "• Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) occurs when there is damage to areas at the back and upper-rear of the brain.\n",
            "These are areas that process visual information and deal with spatial awareness.\n",
            "This means the early symptoms of PCA are often problems identifying objects or reading, even if the eyes are healthy.\n",
            "Someone may also struggle to judge distances when going down stairs, or seem uncoordinated (for example when dressing).\n",
            "• Logopenic aphasia involves damage to the areas in the left side of the brain that produce language.\n",
            "The person’s speech becomes laboured with long pauses.\n",
            "• Frontal variant Alzheimer’s disease involves damage to the lobes at the front of the brain.\n",
            "The symptoms are problems with planning and decision-making.\n",
            "The person may also behave in socially inappropriate ways or seem not to care about the feelings of others.\n",
            "Agraphia is generally seen in association with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).\n",
            "Writing disorders can be an early manifestation of AD.\n",
            "In individuals with AD, the first sign pertaining to writing skills is the selective syntactic simplification of their writing.\n",
            "Individuals will write with less description, detail and complexity, and other markers, such as grammatical errors, may emerge.\n",
            "Different agraphias may develop as AD progresses.\n",
            "In the initial stages of AD, individuals show signs of allographic agraphia and apraxic agraphia.\n",
            "Allographic agraphia is represented in AD individuals by the mixing of lower and upper case letters in words; apraxic agraphia is represented in AD patients through poorly constructed or illegible letters and omission or over repetition of letter strokes.\n",
            "As their AD progresses, so does the severity of their agraphia; they may start to form spatial agraphia, which is the inability to write in a straight horizontal line, and\n",
            "there are often unnecessary gaps between letters and words.\n",
            "A connection between AD and agraphia is the role of memory in normal writing ability.\n",
            "Normal spellers have access to a lexical spelling system that uses a whole-word; when functioning properly, it permits for recall of the spelling of a complete word, not as individual letters or sounds.\n",
            "This system further uses an internal memory store where the spellings of hundreds of words are kept.\n",
            "This is called the graphemic output lexicon and is aptly named in relation to the graphemic buffer, which is the short term memory loop for many of the functions involved in handwriting.\n",
            "When the spelling system cannot be used, such as with unfamiliar words, non-words or words that we do not recognize the spelling for, some people are able to use the phonological process called the sub-lexical spelling system.\n",
            "This system is used to sound out a word and spell it.\n",
            "In AD individuals, memory stores that are used for everyday handwriting are lost as the disease progresses.\n",
            "Agraphia cannot be directly treated, but individuals can be rehabilitated to regain some of their previous writing abilities.\n",
            "For the management of phonological agraphia, individuals are trained to memorize key words, such as a familiar name or object, that can then help them form the grapheme for that phoneme.\n",
            "Management of allographic agraphia can be as simple as having alphabet cards so the individual can write legibly by copying the correct letter shapes.\n",
            "There are few rehabilitation methods for apraxic agraphia; if the individual has considerably better hand control and movement with typing than they do with handwriting, then they can use technological devices.\n",
            "Texting and typing do not require the same technical movements that handwriting does; for these technological methods, only spatial location of the fingers to type is required.\n",
            "If copying skills are preserved in an individual with apraxic agraphia, repeated copying may help shift from the highly intentional and monitored hand movements indicative of apraxic agraphia to a more automated control.\n",
            "Micrographia is a condition that can occur with the development of other disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, and is when handwriting becomes illegible because of small writing.\n",
            "For some individuals, a simple command to write bigger eliminates the issue.\n",
            "• Anagram and Copy Treatment (ACT) uses the arrangement of component letters of target words and then repeated copying of the target word.\n",
            "This is similar to the CART; the chief difference is that the target words for ACT are specific to the individual.\n",
            "Target words that are important in the life of the individual are emphasized because people with deep or global agraphias do not typically have the same memory for the words as other people with agraphia may.\n",
            "Writing can be even very significance to these people as it can cue spoken language.\n",
            "ACT helps in this by facilitating the relearning of a set of personally relevant written words for use in communication.\n",
            "• Copy and Recall Treatment (CART) method helps to reestablish the ability to spell specific words that are learned through repeated copying and recall of target words.CART is more likely to be successful in treating lexical agraphia when a few words are trained to mastery than when a large group of unrelated words is trained.\n",
            "Words chosen can be individualized to the patient, which makes treatment more personalized.\n",
            "• Graphemic buffer uses the training of specific words to improve spelling.\n",
            "Cueing hierarchies and copy and recall method of specific words are used, to work the words into the short-term memory loop, or graphemic buffer.\n",
            "The segmentation of longer words into shorter syllables helps bring words into short-term memory.\n",
            "• Problem solving approach is used as a self-correcting method for phonological errors.\n",
            "The individual sounds\n",
            "out the word and attempts to spell it, typically using an electronic dictionary-type device that indicates correct spelling.\n",
            "This method takes advantage of the preserved sound-to-letter correspondences when they are intact.\n",
            "This approach may improve access to spelling memory, strengthen orthographic representations, or both.\n",

            "Often there is a loss of ability to recognize objects, persons, sounds, shapes, or smells while the specific sense is not defective nor is there any significant memory loss.\n",
            "It is usually related to brain injury or neurological illness, specially after damage to the occipitotemporal border, which is part of the ventral stream.Agnosia only affects a single modality, like as vision or hearing.\n",

            "But they will still be able to reach for it and pick it up.\n",
            "Once they are holding the object, they will be able to use their tactile information pathway—their sense of touch—to identify its use.\n",
            "Agnosia causes when the brain suffers damage along certain pathways.\n",
            "These pathways connect the primary sensory processing areas to the parts that store knowledge and information.\n",
            "Primary sensory processing areas include the visual and auditory cortices.\n",
            "Agnosia is usually caused by lesions on the parietal and temporal lobes of the brain.\n",
            "These lobes are where semantic information and language are stored.\n",

            "Visual agnosia is the most common type of agnosia.\n",
            "This might be because humans’ visual processing areas are so large and complex (Coslett, 2007).\n",
            "Visual agnosia occurs when there is brain damage along the pathways that connect the occipital lobe of the brain with the parietal and temporal lobes.\n",

            "Agnosia is a cognitive disturbance caused by neurological damage that affects associating knowledge with an intact percept\n",
            "within a single modality (vision, audition or somosthesis).\n",
            "Recently, neuroimaging research has led to a better understand of how the brain processes perceptual information and lesion loci that contribute to the various agnosias.\n",
            "It is now thought that agnosia, in the classical sense, represents a top-down disruption in processing of perceptual information.\n",
            "The late 1800s was a period when many neurologists were beginning to describe behavioural disturbances associated with brain injuries.\n",
            "At this point in medical history, little was known about the organization of the cerebral cortex.\n",
            "A prevailing view, connectionistic theory, posited that the brain processed in interconnected regions of specialization.\n",
            "However, a number of physicians of the time continued to reject the idea that specific brain regions were specialized for specific functions.\n",
            "Accordingly, the first description of agnosia was provided in 1890 by Lissauer.\n",
            "His initial description was of a single modality recognition deficit.\n",
            "He described two types of agnoisa, apperceptive and associative agnosias, primarily distinguishing between disorders of perception and knowledge.\n",
            "This binary differentiation has persisted and is still used in neurobehavioural texts.\n",
            "Lissauer stated that focal lesions and combinations of focal lesions could solely impair visual, auditory or somatosensory perception or recognition, leaving the other sensory modalities largely intact.\n",
            "The behaviour displayed in a visual associative agnosia, for example, would be an inability to recognize a key from an array of objects, name a key from a picture or object display, or match a picture of one kind of key with another.\n",
            "Yet the individual would not have lost the ability to “know” what a key was and could demonstrate that knowledge through other modalities: i.e., he or she could name the key if permitted to feel it or respond appropriately to a question like, “What do you use to open a lock?”\n",
            "In recent years, the development of sophisticated neuroimaging tools combined with careful cognitive-behavioural assessment has allowed revision of Lissauer’s model, an elucidation of top-down (feed-back) and bottom-up (feed-forward) processing systems, and an understanding of the complex ways in which processing networks can be disconnected (Mesulam) and disrupted (Mesaulam, 2000; Damasio et al., 2000; Riddoch and Humphreys, 2001).\n",
            "Although pure agnosias do exist, they are rare.\n",
            "Furthermore, careful diagnostic investigation often reveals idiosyncratic patterns of behavioural deficits that differ from one patient to another despite the initial appearance of a similarity (Riddoch and Humphreys, 2001).\n",
            "Before to understanding the agnosias then, it is helpful to briefly describe the general cerebral organization of single modality processing.\n",
            "As a cautionary note, since neuroimaging technology is continuting to improve in its ability to provide a window into the human neurological processing, the description of human cerebral processing summarized in this chapter should be considered preliminary, at best.\n",
            "The human brain is the organ of the body that allows us to adapt our internal body state to information and changes that occur in the environment (Mesaulam, 2000).\n",
            "When we are hungry, the brain directs us to find food in the world around us.\n",
            "When we are tired, we seek sleep.\n",
            "To process information in the environment to meet our survival and personal needs, we need to process sensory information.\n",
            "This starts with a relay of visual, auditory, tactile and olfactory information from the sense organs (eye, ear, skin, nose) to primary sensory cells in the cortex (A1, V1 and S1 and the olfactory lobe respectively).\n",
            "Through early experience, the primary cortical cells become organized into a sensory map that represents salient stimulus qualities of the environment.\n",
            "For instance, cells in the primary auditory cortex form a “tonotopic” map during the critical period of brain development that matches the range of frequencies an infant hears.\n",
            "These sensory maps are not specific to the human brain.\n",
            "In animals, exposure to a variety of animal calls results in\n",
            "an auditory map “tuned” to those calls while exposure to complex auditory signals like human speech result in a map that enables processing of speech stimuli (Chang and Merzenich, 2003).\n",
            "During early development those maps can be distorted by noise within the environment or nervous system or sensory deprivation.\n",
            "Although the sensory maps of the primary sensory regions are malleable after this early set up period, refining distorted maps requires attention to specific stimuli and timed reinforcement.\n",
            "As the brain matures, perceptual refinement of environmental stimuli occurs by development.\n",
            "During human processing, the information encoded in the primary regions drive a feed forward organization of adjacent categorical perception.\n",
            "Like layers of an onion, perceptual organization of the brain develops based on the integrity and “fine tuning” of the sensory system (Mesaulam, 2000).\n",
            "For instance, the auditory regions adjacent to A1 in the left hemisphere process phonemic classifications of one’s native language, while the visual modality regions adjacent to V1 process colour, form, and motion of visual stimuli (Mesaulam, 2000; Damasio et al., 2000).\n",
            "Thereafter, sensory information is processed by more complex unimodal associations and ultimately, transmodal projections to other modality associations, allow integration of stimuli into multimodal concepts, like words which can be processed auditorily and visually.\n",
            "Modality specific deficits can result from lesions that directly disrupt the unimodal perceptual regions.\n",
            "Thus, a lesion in V4, which processes colour perception, will cause acquired colour blindness, or a lesion in V5 (which processes perception of movement) will result in, an inability to perceive motion (Mesaulam, 2000).\n",
            "In individuals with small, localized lesions, detailed assessment can demonstrate that these specific impairments can occur although there is intact visual perception.\n",

            "With larger lesions to the visual association cortex, several attributes of a stimulus might be misperceived.\n",
            "When lesions instead disconnect the sensory/perceptual regions from multimodal association areas, individuals can have more pervasive single modality “associative” disturbances.\n",
            "This is the classic agnosia and most contemporary neuroscientists reserve the term “agnosia” to refer to these types of associative deficits.\n",
            "When the lesions isolate a unimodal association area from other unimodal and heteromodal association areas, it results in an intact perception of the stimulus but inability to attach meaning to the perception.\n",
            "The individual is characteristically able describe details of the object presented to him yet unable to name what she sees, hears or feels.\n",
            "Likewise, because the perception is intact, the individual should be able make a detailed drawing of the object or match two detailed drawings of the same object.\n",
            "But what will generally perplex an examiner is that after drawing or matching the stimulus, the individual will still be unable to tell the examiner what he has just drawn.\n",

            "A patient can be presented with a stimulus to the impaired modality only to help increase their awareness of their deficit.\n",
            "Alternatively, a task can be broken down into its component parts so that the individual can see each part of the problem caused by the deficit.\n",
            "Once the individual acknowledges their perceptual or recognition deficit, a form of treatment may be recommended.\n",
            "There are different forms of treatment such as compensatory strategies with alternate modalities, verbal strategies, alternate cues and organizational strategies.\n",
            "Using verbal descriptions may be helpful for individuals with certain types of agnosia.\n",
            "Individuals such as prosopagnosics may find it useful to listen to a description of their friend or family member and recognize them based on this description more easily than through visual cues.\n",
            "Alternate cues may be speciallyparticularly useful to an individual with environmental agnosia or prosopagnosia.\n",
            "Alternate cues for an individual with environmental agnosia may include colour cues or tactile markers to symbolize a new room or to remember an area by.\n",
            "Prosopagnosics may use alternate cues such as a scar on an individual’s face or crooked teeth in order to recognize the individual.\n",
            "Organizational strategies may be very helpful for an individual with visual agnosia.\n",
            "For instance organizing clothes according to different hangers provides tactile cues for the individual, making it easier to identify certain forms of clothing as opposed to relying solely on visual cues.\n",
            "These strategies elicit the use of an unaffected modality.\n",
            "For instance visual agnosics can use tactile information in replacement of visual information.\n",
            "Alternatively, an individual with\n",
            "prosopagnosia can use auditory information in order to replace visual information.\n",
            "For example, an individual with prosopagnosia can wait for someone to speak, and will usually recognize the individual from their speech.\n",
            "Social-emotional agnosia is because of to a right cerebral, or bilateral temporal and amygdala injury.\n",
            "Patients typically are unable to correctly perceive or comprehend social-emotional nuances conveyed through voice, gesture, or facial expression.\n",
            "Patients diagnosed with “schizophrenia” and children afflicted with autism, often appear to suffer from abnormalities involving social-emotional perceptual and expressive functioning, and amygdala and temporal lobe abnormalities have been found in these populations.\n",
            "If due to amygdala and temporal lobe injury, this may explain why these individuals appear to have extreme difficulty determining and identifying the motivational and emotional significance of externally occuring events, to discern social-emotional nuances conveyed by others, or to select what behaviour is appropriate given a specific social context.\n",
            "In consequence, in addition to their other afflictions, autistic children or schizophrenic adults may appear socially emotionally blunted or agnosic to varying degrees.\n",
            "Social-emotional agnosias are commonly observed following amygdala, and amygdala, and right cerebral lesions involving the temporal lobe in particular (Joseph 1988a, 1992a).\n",
            "For example, with damage to the right temporal-occipital region, there can result a severe disturbance in the ability to recognize the faces of friends, loved ones, or pets or to discriminate and identify even facial affect (Braun et al. 1994); prosopagnosia.\n",
            "In fact, with gradual deterioration and degeneration of the right inferior temporal lobe, patients may suffer a progressive prosopagnosia (Evans et al. 2005).\n",
            "Some patients may in fact be unable to recognize their own face in the mirror.\n",
            "In large part these neocortical deficits are due to limbic system disconnection, and/ or destruction of specific limbic nuclei such as the amygdala.\n",
            "For example, lesions that destroy amygdala fibers of passage to the right or left temporal lobe, essentially disconnect the neocortex and amygdala such that they can no longer receive or transmit appropriate signals.\n",
            "Besides, lesions to only the right or left amygdala (n primates) may induce social-emotional agnosic states, but only in regard to stimuli and persons in the contralateral half of auditory, visual, and tactile space (Downer 1961); e.g.\n",
            "only the right or left hemisphere may become severely effected.\n",
            "Hence, in humans, given right cerebral dominance for social and emotional stimuli, a right sided disconnection or destruction of the amygdala can exert profound influences regardless of which hemisphere is perceiving and responding to emotional stimuli.\n",
            "Among primates and mammals, bilateral destruction of the amygdala significantly disturbs the ability to determine and identify the motivational and emotional significance of externally occuring events, to discern social-emotional nuances conveyed by others, or to select what behaviour is appropriate given a specific social context.\n",
            "Bilateral lesions lower responsiveness to aversive and social stimuli, reduce aggressiveness, fearfulness, competitiveness, dominance, and social interest (Rosvold et al. 1954).\n",
            "Indeed, this condition is so pervasive that subjects seem to have tremendous difficulty discerning the meaning or recognizing the significance of even common objects — a condition sometimes referred to as “psychic blindness”, or, the “Kluver-Bucy syndrome”.\n",
            "Thus, animals with bilateral amygdaloid destruction, although able to see and interact with their environment, may respond in an emotionally blunted manner, and seem unable to recognize what they see, feel, and experience.\n",
            "Things seem stripped of meaning such that even the ability to appropriately interact with loved ones is impaired; similar, in some respects to what occurs in autism and with adults afflicted with schizophrenia.\n",
            "For instance, Terzian & Ore (2011) described a young man who following bilateral removal of the amygdala subsequently demonstrated an\n",
            "inability to recognize anyone, including close friends, relatives and his mother.\n",
            "He ceased to respond in an emotional manner to his environment and seemed unable to recognize feelings expressed by others.\n",
            "In addition, he became extremely socially unresponsive such that he preferred to sit in isolation, well away from others.\n",
            "Among primates who have undergone bilateral amygdaloid removal, once they are released from captivity and allowed to return to their social group, a social-emotional agnosia becomes readily apparent as they no longer respond to or seem able to appreciate or understand emotional or social nuances.\n",
            "Infact, they seen to have little or no interest in social activity and persistently attempt to avoid contact with others.\n",
            "If approached they withdraw, and if followed they flee.\n",
            "Infact, they behave as if they have no understanding of what is expected of them or what others intend or are attempting to convey, even when the behaviour is quite friendly and concerned.\n",
            "Among adults with bilateral lesions, total isolation seems to be preferred.\n",
            "Besides, they no longer display appropriate social or emotional behaviours, and if kept in captivity will fall in dominance in a group or competitive situation — even when formerly dominant.\n",
            "As might be expected, maternal behaviour is severly affected.\n",
            "According to Kling (1972), mothers will behave as if their “infant were a strange object be be mouthed, bitten and tossed around as though it were a rubber ball”.\n",
            "Given the very similarities between amygdala destruction and the social-emotional agnosias demonstrated by certain subgroups of those classified as schizophrenic, as well as those diagnosed as autistic, it would thus appear that amygdala/temporal lobe dysfunction is implicated as a major source of psychopathology in these patient populations.\n",
            "Finger agnosia is not a form of finger blindness, as the name suggests.\n",
            "Nor is it an inability to recognize a finger as a finger.\n",
            "Rather, the difficulty involves naming and differentiating among the fingers of either hand as well as the hands of others (Gerstmann, 1940).\n",
            "This includes pointing to fingers named by the examiner, or moving or indicating a particular finger on one hand when the same finger is stimulated on the opposite hand.\n",
            "Besides, if you touch their finger while eyes are closed, and ask them to touch the same finger they may have difficulty.\n",
            "Generally patients who have difficulty identifying fingers by name or simply differentiating between them non-verbally also suffer from receptive language abnormalities (Sanquet, et al. 1971).\n",
            "However, disturbances differentiating between the different fingers can occur independent of language abnormalities or with right parietal injuries (in which case the problem is seen only with the patient’s left hand).\n",
            "Generally, however, finger agnosia is associated with left parietal (as well as temporal-occipital) lobe lesions in which case the agnosia is demonstrable in both hands.\n",
            "It is also part of the constellation of symptoms often referred to as Gerstmanns Syndrome, i.e.\n",
            "agraphia, acalculia, left-right disorientation, finger agnosia (Gerstmann, 1942).\n",
            "Gerstmann’s symptom complex is most often associated with lesions in the area of the supramarginal gyrus and superior parietal lobule (Hrbek, 1977; Strub & Geschwind, 1983).\n",
            "Simultanagnosia is an inability to see more than one thing or one aspect of an object at a time, although individual details may be correctly perceived.\n",
            "However, the patient is unable to relate the different details so as to discern what is being viewed.\n",
            "For instance, if shown a picture of a man holding an umbrella and a suitcase, they may see the suitcase and the man, and the umbrella, but be unable to relate these items into a meaningfull whole.\n",
            "In fact, by surrounding the object with other objects perceptual recognition may deteriorate even further.\n",
            "With severe damage the patient may be unable to even recognize individual objects.\n",
            "Indeed, one patient I examined with bilateral posterior parietal-occipital\n",
            "damage (following a bilateral posterior artery stroke) could only identify parts of objects, but not the object itself.\n",
            "In part, this is due to a breakdown in the ability to perform serial feature-by-feature visual analysis, and is sometimes accompanied by abnormal eye movements.\n",
            "Nevertheless, a variety of anatomical regions, when compromised can give rise to this abnormality.\n",
            "For example, simultanagnosia has been noted to occur with left, right and bilateral superior occipital lobe lesions, or injuries involving the frontal eye fields.\n",
            "Depending on the laterality and location of the injury, e.g., right vs left inferior/medial vs superior temporal lobe, patients may display category specific agnosias.\n",
            "For instance, a 27-year old man was examined who had sustained a massive right inferiorposterior temporal lobe injury that also involved surgical removal, was able to recognize pictures of tools (he had been a carpenter) but could not recognize or correctly name pictures of animals and he could not correctly remember facial stimuli that he had been shown five minutes earlier and could not differentiate them from faces he had not seen.\n",
            "Contrarily, a 43 year old woman who had been a waitress, and had developed a left inferior temporal lobe glioma that required surgical removal (coupled with chemotherapy) was able to recognize and name pictures of animals and could remember different pictures of faces, but had considerable difficulty recognizing and naming common household objects.\n",
            "In this regard a 47-year old woman I examined who was subsequently found to have a calcium cyst growing from the skull into the right superior temporal lobe, was able to name pictures of animals, tools and household objects.\n",
            "However, she was almost completely unable to recognize and correctly name animal and humans sounds (e.g. a baby crying, a crowd cheering, a lion roaring) which had been briefly presented, but was better able to recognize non-living sounds such as a creaking door, or a hammer hammering—though these abilities were also compromised.\n",
            "These findings, which require independent confirmation, raises the possibility that the temporal lobes are not only able to distinguish between living and non-living things including tools and faces, but that the right temporal lobe is specialized for perceiving living creatures (and the sounds they make) whereas the left is specialized for perceiving and naming non-living things, such as tools and household objects.\n",
            "The neocortex of the inferior temporla lobe is specialized for receiving, analyzing, discriminating, recognizing and recalling complex visual information and is involved in attention and visually guided behaviour, comprising the recollection and learning of visual discriminations (Gross, 1972) and memory for objects and spatial locations (Nunn et al., 2015; Ploner et al., 2015).\n",
            "If the temporal lobe is injured, these functions become compromised.\n",
            "For example, Kimura (1963) found that patients with right vs left temporal lobe injury were impaired when presented with overlapping nonsense shapes and then immediately tested for recognition.\n",
            "Similarly, Meier and French (1965), found that those with right vs left temporal lobe injuries were impaired when asked to make visual discriminations when presented with fragmented concentric circle patterns—skills which are also related to visual closure and gestalt formation.\n",
            "More recently, Nunn et al., (2015) found that right vs left temporal lobectomy patients were more impaired when required to remember and recognize toys and recall their location.\n",
            "Cells in the ITL have very large, bilateral visual receptive fields which include the fovea, and many are sensitive to direction of stimulus movement, colour, contrast, size, shape, orientation and are involved in the perception of three dimensional objects and the supramodal analysis of information already processed in the association areas.\n",
            "Thus inferior temporal (IT) neurons appear to take part in the last stages of visual analysis for form recognition and receive terminal fibers from the primary and association visual areas; that is, via the ventral visual stream.\n",
            "Indeed, a single neuron can respond to a combination of these features and many will fire selectively in response to particular shapes and faces.\n",
            "In fact, based on single cell recordings, some of these temporal lobe neurons have been found to become particularly excited when presented with two dimensional patterns or three dimensional objects such as hands, brushes, and in particular, faces (Deismone & Gross, 1979; Gross et al., 1972; Nakamura et al. 1994; Richmond et al., 1983; Richmond et al.2013).\n",
            "A number of different feature detectors are found and the majority probably act collectively so as code and assemble a particular shape, including the formation of gestalts and thus the performance of visual closure, especially the right temporal region.\n",
            "Via closure an individual can detect a partial stimulus and determine if the stimulus is that of a human face vs a rabbit.\n",
            "Hence, if these areas are damaged, and these feature detecting neurons are destroyed, the patient will lose the ability to visually recognize a variety of visual stimuli, including the human face.\n",
            "Graphesthesia is the ability to recognize writing on the skin purely by the sensation of touch.\n",
            "Its name derives from Greek graphç (“writing”) and aisthçsis (“perception”). Graphesthesia tests combined cortical sensation; therefore, it is necessary that primary sensation be intact.\n",
            "During medical or neurological examination graphesthesia is tested in order to test for certain neurological conditions such as; lesions in brainstem, spinal cord, sensory cortexor thalamus.\n",
            "An examiner writes single numbers or simple letters on the skin (usually the palm) with something that will provide a clear stimulus, such as a broken tongue depressor, pen cap etc.\n",
            "Prior to the start of testing, an agreement may be reached between the examiner and the patient as to the orientation of the letters, although this is often unnecessary, since orientation and size of the figures are rarely an issue.\n",
            "The crucial aspect of testing graphesthesia, as with any sensory testing, is to establish that the patient understands the test, hence the test is commenced, in the hemiplegic patient, on the normal, intact hand.\n",
            "This also permits the examiner to establish the patient’s numeracy, since semi-numerate patients may have difficulties performing the task.\n",
            "The patient provides a verbal response identifying the figure that was drawn.\n",
            "If the patient has a speech or language impairment that prevents them from verbalizing an answer, the answer can be selected from a series of images shown to them.\n",
            "Loss of graphesthesia indicates either parietal lobe damage on the side opposite the hand tested or damage to the dorsal columns pathway at any point between the tested point and the contralateral parietal lobe.\n",
            "The major clinical utility of the test in the 21st century is in the condition,cortico-basal ganglionic degeneration, where, in addition to evidence of basal ganglia dysfunction, the presence of cortical sensory loss is likely to have reasonably high specificity for the diagnosis.\n",
            "Testing graphesthesia can be substituted for stereognosis if a patient is unable to grasp an object.\n",
            "Dyslexia has been around and has been defined in different ways.\n",
            "For example, in 1968, the World Federation of Neurologists defined dyslexia as “a disorder in children who, despite conventional classroom experience, fail to attain the language skills of reading, writing, and spelling commensurate with their intellectual abilities.”\n",
            "The International Dyslexia Association offers the following definition of dyslexia: “Dyslexia is a specific learning disability that is neurobiological in origin.\n",
            "It is characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities.\n",
            "These difficulties typically result from a deficit in the phonological component of language\n",
            "provision of effective classroom instruction.\n",

            "The severity of dyslexia can vary from mild to severe.\n",
            "The sooner dyslexia is treated, the more favorable the outcome.\n",
            "However, it is never too late for people with dyslexia to learn to improve their language skills.\n",
            "Dyslexia, also called reading disorder, is characterized by trouble with reading despite normal intelligence.\n",
            "Different people are affected to varying degrees.\n",
            "Problems may include difficulties in spelling words, reading quickly, writing words, “sounding out” words in the head, pronouncing words when reading aloud and understanding what one reads.\n",
            "Generaly these difficulties are first noticed at school.\n",
            "When someone who previously could read loses their ability, it is known as alexia.\n",
            "The difficulties are involuntary and people with this disorder have normal desire to learn.\n",
            "The cause of dyslexia is believed to involve both genetic and environmental factors.\n",
            "Some cases run in families.\n",
            "It often occurs in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is related to similar difficulties with numbers.\n",
            "It may begin in adulthood as the result of a traumatic brain injury, stroke, or dementia.\n",
            "The underlying mechanisms are problems within thebrain’s language processing.\n",
            "Dyslexia is diagnosed through a series of tests of memory, spelling, vision, and reading skills.Dyslexia is separate from reading difficulties caused by insufficient teaching; or either hearing or vision problems.\n",
            "Treatment involves adjusting teaching methods to meet the person’s needs.\n",

            "Other sources, however, define it simply as inability to read in the context of normal intelligence, and distinguish between developmental dyslexia (a learning disorder) and acquired dyslexia(loss of the ability to read caused by brain damage).\n",
            "ICD 10, the manual of medical diagnosis used in much\n",
            "of the world, comprises separate diagnoses for “developmental dyslexia” (81.0) and for “dyslexia and alexia” (48.0).\n",
            "DSM 5, the manual of psychiatric diagnosis used in the United States, does not specifically define dyslexia, justifying this decision by stating that “the many definitions of dyslexia and dyscalculia meant those terms would not be useful as disorder names or in the diagnostic criteria”.\n",
            "Instead it includes dyslexia in a category called specific learning disorders.\n",
            "In early childhood, symptoms that correlate with a later diagnosis of dyslexia include delayed onset of speech, difficulty distinguishing left from right, difficulty with direction, as well as being easily distracted by background noise.\n",

            "Dyslexia is often accompanied by several learning disabilities, but it is unclear whether they share underlying neurological causes.\n",
            "These associated disabilities include:\n",
            "• Dysgraphia – A disorder which primarily expresses itself through difficulties with writing or typing, but in some cases through difficulties associated with eye–hand coordination and direction- or sequence-oriented processes such as tying knots or carrying out repetitive tasks.\n",
            "In dyslexia, dysgraphia is often multifactorial, due to impaired letter-writing automaticity, organizational and elaborative difficulties, and impaired visual word forming which makes it more difficult to retrieve the visual picture of words required for spelling.\n",
            "• Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder – A significant degree of comorbidity has been reported between ADHD and reading disorders such as dyslexia.\n",
            "ADHD occurs in 12–24% of all individuals with dyslexia.\n",
            "• Auditory processing disorder – A listening disability that affects the ability to process auditory information.\n",
            "This can lead to problems with auditory memory and auditorysequencing.\n",
            "Several people with dyslexia have auditory processing problems, and may develop their own logographic cues to compensate for this kind of deficit.\n",
            "Some research indicates that auditory processing skills could be the primary shortfall in dyslexia.\n",
            "• Developmental coordination disorder – A neurological condition characterized by marked difficulty in carrying out routine tasks involving balance, fine-motor control,kinesthetic coordination, difficulty in the use of speech sounds, problems with short-term memory, and organization.\n",
            "Researchers have been trying to find the neurobiological basis of dyslexia since the condition was first identified in 1881.\n",
            "For instance, some have tried to associate the common problem among dyslexics of not being able to see letters clearly to abnormal development of their visual nerve cells.\n",

            "In all except two studies, there were found to be great differences between the two in one or more anatomical structures.\n",
            "Since anosognosia involves a broad brain network related to self-awareness, a variety of anatomical structures are involved, especially the anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, medial frontal cortex, and inferior parietal cortex.\n",
            "Three of the positive studies included individuals with schizophrenia who had never been treated with medications so the observed brain changes cannot be attributed to the treatment.\n",
            "Probably the most striking instance of anosognosia can be found in brain-damaged patients, affected by a complete contralesional hemiplegia (for a review Bottini et al., 2010).\n",
            "These patients may deny that there is anything wrong with their contralesional limbs and claim of being able to perform any kind of action.\n",
            "Besides, when asked to perform a purposeful movement with the paralysed limb they may appear convinced of having accomplished the requested action despite unambiguous proof to the contrary coming from different sensory channels.\n",
            "It is worth noticing that such “on line” confabulations, recently termed “illusory limb movements” (Feinberg, 2007), are not present in all anosognosic patients.\n",
            "The symptomatology of anosognosia for hemiplegia can vary between and within patients.\n",
            "This disturbance is frequent after damage to the right hemisphere, with a prevalence ranging from 20% to 50% of hemiplegic patients, depending on the studies, the differences being related to the time of evaluation (acute vs. chronic phase of the illness) and selection criteria (e.g., Pia et al. 2004).\n",
            "When explicitly questioned about the condition of their limbs, patients may show different degrees of denial ranging from emotional indifference (anosodiaphoria), in which the motor problems may be admitted but without any concerns, to resolute and intractable unawareness of the disease.\n",
            "Additionally, productive symptoms, as verbal confabulations about the possibility of moving the plegic limb, and delusional beliefs may coexist.\n",
            "In this latter case, patients may experience their limb as not belonging to them (asomatognosia) or attribute their own body parts to other persons (somatoparaphrenia).\n",

            "violent attitude against those ‘alien’ limbs (misoplegia).\n",
            "The interpretation of anosognosia for hemiplegia is not straightforward.\n",
            "Theories that explain it either as a secondary consequence of sensory feedback deficits or as due to the co-occurrence of various kinds of neuropsychological disorders are not thought to be exhaustive explanations.\n",
            "Indeed, double dissociations have been shown between anosognosia for hemiplegia and sensory/cognitive deficits.\n",
            "It is worth noticing, however, that the motivational factor account has been recently re-proposed in terms of abnormal affective regulation or altered emotional and attitudinal processes implicated in self-attribution of perceptual experiences (e.g., Turnbull et al., 2005).\n",
            "A lesion to a right-lateralized emotionregulation system might crucially contribute to the emergence of anosognosia for hemiplegia.\n",
            "Consistently, some anatomical data show an overlap between areas underpinning motor awareness and those subserving emotions.\n",
            "Additionally, right brain-damaged patients often develop emotional changes and difficulty tolerating aversive emotional states (Turnbull et al., 2005).\n",
            "Thus, although the emotional theories do not explain the full-fledged syndrome of anosognosia for hemiplegia, it is possible that the complex interactions between individual predispositions and brain dysfunction would shape the way in which denial manifest itself in different patients.\n",
            "Recently, it has been proposed that anosognosia for hemiplegia might be explained as a domain specific disorder of motor control (Berti and Pia, 2006).\n",
            "Anatomo-clinical correlations and lesion analyses have shown that anosognosia for hemiplegia follows brain damages within lateral premotor and insular cortex.\n",
            "A possibility is that this damage would alter the monitoring of voluntary actions, thus preventing patients to distinguish between movement and no-movement states.\n",
            "Moreover, the (non-veridical) feeling of movement would arise from an intact motor intentionality subserved by a normal activity of the brain structures that implement the intention-programming system (Berti and Pia 2006).\n",
            "Evidence of preserved movement intentionality in anosognosic patients comes from the fact that they may show normal proximal muscle electrical activity in the affected side when they believe they are moving the plegic limb (Berti et al., 2007).\n",
            "Moreover, it has been shown that in bimanual action (Garbarini & Pia, 2013) the motor execution of the anosognosic patients’ intact hand is affected by the intention to move the paretic hand.\n",
            "Interestingly, such an intentional stance dominates their subjective experience of willed actions because patients falsely detect movement of their plegic arm when they intend to move it, respect to when they do not (Fotopoulou et al., 2008).\n",
            "Patients affected by hemianaesthesia (i.e., the loss of tactile/ proprioceptive sensibility on one side of the body), can be completely unaware of their sensory impairment (e.g., Marcel et al., 2004; Spinazzola et al., 2008).\n",
            "Interestingly, unawareness for hemianaesthesia can be dissociated from anosognosia for hemiplegia, unilateral neglect, intellectual impairment and general self-monitoring on both functional and anatomical ground.\n",
            "This form of denial seems to be more frequently associated to lesions of those brain structures underpinning sensory-spatial processing (e.g., insular, temporal and subcortical lesions mainly affecting basal ganglia).\n",
            "Hence, as for the cerebral circuits of self-monitoring processes for primary sensory functions are located in areas involved both in the execution of the primary functions and in the emergence of awareness related to the monitoring of the same functions.\n",
            "Current theories suggest that patients affected by anosognosia for hemianaestesia have a nonveridical sensory awareness generated as an illusory experience by the failure to distinguish between an imagined sensation and a real, physical one (Pia et al., 2014).\n",
            "The brain structures underpinning sensory-spatial processing would be the neural basis of sensory self-monitoring allowing the distinction between ‘veridical’ and ‘non-veridical’ sensory\n",

            "Anosognosia may occur in cerebral achoromatopsia, a quite rare neurological disorder characterized by a complete or partial loss of colour vision after a bilateral cortical damage to the ventral occipito-temporal cortex.\n",
            "Patients affected by this disorder claim to see the world in black and white and are usually aware of their visual deficit.\n",
            "However, there are a few descriptions of patients who either did not notice their colour perception deficit or did so only some time after the brain damage, suggesting unawareness for the loss of colour vision.\n",
            "Inspite of verbal and nonverbal/perceptual testing showing the presence of severe colour blindness, the patients may still claim a normal colour vision, even when faced with their errors in naming colours.\n",
            "It is worth noticing that colour vision may improve with time and a parallel improvement in awareness can be observed.\n",
            "The simultaneous occurrence of achoromatopsia and anosognosia, their parallel recovery, and their lesion site in visual areas suggest that both deficits were due to dysfunction of the same brain region, implying again that normal perception and normal monitoring share common anatomical substrates.\n",
            "As mentioned above, anosognosia may occur also within more complex cognitive disorders as, for instance, schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease.\n",
            "In these pathologies, it is very hard to individuate a common core explaining the different denial behaviours.\n",
            "The fact that in many instances there is a severe intellectual impairment is of course a confounding factor.\n",
            "However, various data seems to support the idea that also in these cases unawareness can be selective and neurologically based.\n",
            "In schizophrenia, it has been often used the term ‘lack of insight’ to indicate a broad construct encompassing unawareness of the disorder, of the effects of treatment, of social consequences, of the occurrence of psychiatric symptoms and difficulty in labeling them.\n",
            "Recently, however, numerous data suggest that unawareness in schizophrenia might have similarities with the concept of anosognosia: persistence despite all contrary evidence, confabulations to explain the symptoms, frontal lobe impairments and domain specificity (e.g., Pia & Tamietto 2006).\n",
            "For example, there can be dissociations between unawareness for negative and positive symptoms.\n",
            "Moreover, unawareness for pathological involuntary movement (i.e., tardive dyskenisia) can be present for some muscular group and not for others akin to what has been reported for patients with anosognosia for hemiplegia who may be aware of the motor deficit affecting the lower limb and not of the contemporary presence of the motor impairment of the upper limb and viceversa.\n",
            "Likewise, anosognosia in Alzheimer’s disease has not been initially considered as a domain specific impairment Indeed, data from early/acute stages of the disease and from different aspects of functioning including cognition, mood, behaviour and daily activities have been often grouped in a single anosognosia index.\n",
            "However, it has been recently suggested that also unawareness in Alzheimer’s disease might be interpreted as a selective and neurologically based condition.\n",
            "It seems to be strictly connected to frontal lobe impairments (e.g., patients with anosognosia and Alzheimer’s disease often show a reduction of cerebral haematic flow in the frontal regions, deficits of executive functions and extrapyramidal signs) and can be observed for some deficits and not for others.\n",
            "Relatively little has been discovered about the cause of the condition since its initial identification.\n",
            "Recent studies from the empirical data are prone to consider anosognosia a multicomponential syndrome or multi-faceted phenomenon.\n",
            "That is it can be manifested by failure to be aware of a number of specific deficits, including motor (hemiplegia), sensory (hemianaesthesia, hemianopia), spatial (unilateral neglect), memory (dementia), and language (receptive aphasia) due to impairment of anatomofunctionally discrete monitoring systems.\n",
            "Anosognosia is relatively common following different etiologies of brain injury, such as stroke and traumatic brain injury (e.g. 10%–18% in the case of anosognosia for hemiparesis with onset of acute stroke), but can appear to occur in conjunction with virtually any neurological impairment.\n",
            "It is more frequent in the acute than in the chronic phase and more prominent for assessment in the cases with right hemispheric lesions than with the left kinds.\n",
            "However, it is not related to global mental confusion, cognitive flexibility, other major intellectual disturbance, or mere sensory/ perceptual deficits.\n",
            "Anosognosia can be selective in that an affected person with multiple impairments may seem unaware of only one handicap, while appearing to be fully aware of any others.\n",
            "For example, anosognosia for hemiplegia may occur with intact awareness of visuo-spatial unilateral neglect, or vice versa.\n",
            "This phenomenon of double dissociation can be an indicator of domain- specific disorders of awareness modules, meaning that brain damage can selectively impact the self-monitoring process of one specific physical or cognitive function.\n",
            "The condition does not appear to be directly related to sensory loss and is thought to be caused by damage to higher level neurocognitive processes that are involved in integrating sensory information with processes that support spatial or bodily representations (including the somatosensory system).\n",
            "Anosognosia is thought to be related tounilateral neglect, a condition often found after damage to the non-dominant (usually the right) hemisphere of the cerebral cortex in which sufferers seem unable to attend to, or sometimes comprehend, anything on a particular side of their body (usually the left).\n",
            "There are also studies showing that the maneuver of vestibular stimulation could temporarily improve both the syndrome of spatial unilateral neglect and of anosognosia for left hemiplegia.\n",
            "Combining the findings of hemispheric asymmetry to the right, association to spatial unilateral neglect, and the temporal improvement on both syndromes, it is suggested there can be a spatial component underlying the mechanism of anosognosia for motor weakness and their neural processes could be modulated similarly.\n",
            "There were some cases of anosognosia for right hemiplegia after left hemisphere damage, but the frequency of this type of anosognosia has not been estimated.\n",
            "Those diagnosed with dementia of the Alzheimer’s type, often display this dearth of awareness and insist that nothing is wrong with them.\n",
            "Anosognosia may occur as part of receptive aphasia, a language disorder that causes poor comprehension of speech and the production of fluent but incomprehensible sentences.\n",
            "A patient with receptive aphasia cannot correct his own phonetic errors and shows “anger and disappointment with the person with whom s/ he is speaking that person fails to understand her/him.”\n",
            "This may be a result of brain damage to the posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus, believed to contain representations of word sounds.\n",
            "With those representations significantly distorted, patients with receptive aphasia are unable to monitor their mistakes.\n",
            "Other patients with receptive aphasia are fully aware of their condition and speech inhibitions, but cannot monitor their condition, which is not the same as anosognosia and therefore cannot explain the occurrence ofneologistic jargon.\n",
            "Mental illness comes in many forms.\n",
            "Depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and the anxiety disorders all have the potential to be crippling, and ruin lives.\n",
            "Yet as terrible as depression, mania, psychosis, and the other symptoms of these disorders can be, there is one that stands out as the most damaging of all:\n",
            "This obscure word, which is pronounced “uh-no-sog-no-zha,” means “denial of illness,” and is more serious than you might think.\n",
            "Most of the people understand the psychological concept of denial, which is a refusal to believe an uncomfortable truth.\n",
            "Who\n",
            "hasn’t heard heard a heavy drinker, eater, smoker, or drug user say, “I can quite any time I want,” or someone with a chronic cough (which may indicate a serious illness) say, “It’s not important—It’s just a cough.”\n",
            "Pressing the denier on the obvious gap between reality and his belief typically yields a flurry of thin excuses that support his position, and can provoke an outburst of anger if continued long enough.\n",
            "Denial serves a useful purpose in helping people cope with sudden change, and is harmless as long as it is not maintained too long.\n",
            "Denial becomes harmful when it interferes with a person’s ability to cope effectively with the challenges he faces.\n",
            "Fortunately, denial is temporary in most cases, and even chronic deniers can can learn better over time.\n",
            "Anosognosia different.\n",
            "It is not simply denial of a problem, but the genuine inability to recognize that the problem exists.\n",
            "It is a common consequence of brain injuries, and occurs to varying degrees in such disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer’s disease.\n",
            "(I hasten to add that “common” does not mean “universal!”\n",
            "Most of the people who suffer from these illnesses are quite aware that they are sick.) Someone who has anosognosia isn’t being difficult, or refusing to face the truth.\n",
            "He is literally unable to believe that his illness is, in fact, an illness.\n",
            "As a result, he does not see any reason to take medication that can control his illness.\n",
            "Several people who have anosognosia will refuse to take medication for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, because they do not believe they are ill. If pushed, they may give the appearance of cooperation, while secretly discarding their medication.\n",
            "In the case of paranoid schizophrenia, where the patient believes others are conspiring to harm him or control his life, the combination of anosognosia and paranoia can provoke the him to violent action in an attempt to escape his “persecutors.”\n",
            "(Sadly, the often debilitating side effects of antipsychotic medication, which, unlike his illness, are all too apparent to the patient, provide supporting evidence for his beliefs.) For a symptom with such an obscure name, anosognosia plays a prominent role in both law and medicine.\n",
            "Treatment for most illnesses is taken at the discretion of the patient, who is free to seek, select, or decline treatment, as he considers appropriate.\n",
            "However, there are times when the individual’s right to control his medical treatment conflicts with other important principles, namely, the sanctity of life, and the protection of others from harm.\n",
            "A person who is in the grip of a severe psychotic episode, who is judged likely to harm himself or someone else, may legally be committed to a psychiatric hospital for evaluation and treatment, on an involuntary basis.\n",
            "Such treatment usually consists of antipsychotic or moodstabilizer medications, observation, and possibly restraint.\n",
            "Most patients who are prone to psychosis (primarily, those with schizophrenia) do not have any particular desire to harm other people.\n",
            "The danger comes not from a desire to harm, but from hallucinations and delusions that can drive violent actions.\n",
            "(For instance, a patient may sincerely believe he is fighting for his life against an evil force, when in reality he is attacking an innocent person.) So it is not surprising that patients who are aware of the nature of their illness, and the risk of such harm, generally do prefer treatment to prevent violent incidents.\n",
            "Similarly, patients who have anosognosia about their psychotic symptoms, but whose behaviour is harmless, may not have a need for medication that justifies removal of their right to make decisions about their treatment However, those psychotic patients who are at risk for committing violent acts, and also have anosognosia, are both dangerous, and unable to believe that anything is wrong with them.\n",
            "Because of this belief, they will refuse treatment, and remain dangerous.\n",
            "These are the patients whose right to control their own treatment conflicts with the right of others to safety.\n",
            "Lastly, each case must be handled on its own merits, and someone must make the difficult calls—and be prepared to live with the consequences.\n",
            "It is because of anosognosia that such calls must be made.\n",
            "Clinically, anosognosia is often assessed by giving patients an anosognosia questionnaire in order to assess their metacognitive knowledge of deficits.\n",
            "However, neither the existing questionnaires applied in the clinics are designed thoroughly for evaluating the multidimensional nature of this clinical phenomenon; nor are the responses obtained via offline questionnaire capable of revealing the discrepancy of awareness observed from their online task performance.\n",
            "The discrepancy is noticed when patients showed no awareness of their deficits from the offline responses to the questionnaire but demonstrated reluctance or verbal circumlocution when asked to perform an online task.\n",
            "For instance, patients with anosognosia for hemiplegia may find excuses not to perform a bimanual task even though they do not admit it is because of their paralyzed arms.\n",
            "Similar situation can happen on patients with anosognosia for cognitive deficits after traumatic brain injury when monitoring their errors during the tasks regarding their memory and attention (online emergent awareness) and when predicting their performance right before the same tasks (online anticipatory awareness).\n",
            "It can also takeplace among patients with dementia and anosognosia for memory deficit when prompted with dementia-related words, displaying possible pre-attentive processing and implicit knowledge of their memory problems.\n",
            "More interestingly, patients with anosognosia may overestimate their performance when asked in first-person formed questions but not from a third-person perspective when the questions referring to others.\n",
            "When assessing the causes of anosognosia within stroke patients, CT scans have been used to assess where the greatest amount of damage is found within the various areas of the brain.\n",
            "Stroke patients with mild and severe levels of anosognosia (determined by response to an anosognosia questionnaire) have been linked to lesions within the temporoparietal and thalamic regions, when compared to those who experience moderate anosognosia, or none at all.\n",
            "In contrast, after suffering a stroke, people who have moderate anosognosia have a higher frequency of lesions involving the basal ganglia, compared to those with mild or severe anosognosia.\n",
            "Although largely used to describe unawareness of impairment after brain injury or stroke, the term ‘anosognosia’ is occasionally used to describe the dearth of insight shown by some people who suffer from anorexia nervosa.\n",
            "They do not seem to recognize that they suffer from a mental illness.\n",
            "There is proof that anosognosia related to schizophrenia may be the result of frontal lobe damage.\n",
            "E. Fuller Torrey, a psychiatrist and schizophrenia researcher, has stated that among those with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, anosognosia is the most prevalent reason for not taking medications.\n",
            "You wake up in a hospital bed, scared, confused, and attached to a network of tubes and beeping equipment.\n",
            "After doctors assault you with a barrage of questions and tests, your family emerges from the sea of unfamiliar faces surrounding you and explains what has happened; you have had a stroke in the right half of your brain, and you are at least temporarily paralyzed on your left side.\n",
            "You wiggle your left toes to test yourself; everything seems normal.\n",
            "You lift your left arm to show your family that you are obviously not paralyzed.\n",
            "However, this demonstration does not elicit the happy response you expect; it only causes your children to exchange worried glances with the doctors.\n",
            "No matter how many times you attempt to demonstrate movement in the left half of your body, the roomful of people insists that you are paralyzed.\n",
            "And you are, you just do not know it.\n",
            "How is this possible?\n",
            "You are suffering from anosognosia, a condition in which an ill patient is unaware of her own illness or the deficits resulting from her illness.\n",
            "Anosognosia\n",
            "occurs at least temporarily in over 50% of stroke victims who suffer from paralysis on the side of the body opposite the stroke, a condition known as hemiplegia.\n",
            "Patients with anosognosia for hemiplegia insist they can do things like lift both legs, touch their doctor’s nose with a finger on their paralyzed side, and walk normally.\n",
            "These patients are much less likely to regain independence after their stroke than patients without anosognosia, primarily because they overestimate their own abilities in unsafe situations.\n",
            "However, the implications of the illness go far beyond those for patients who suffer from it; anosognosia brings questions of the origin of self-awareness to the forefront.\n",
            "How can someone lose the ability to know when she is or is not moving?\n",
            "Is this some type of elaborate Freudian defense mechanism, or is this person entirely unaware of her illness?\n",
            "How is self-awareness represented in the brain, and is this representation isolated from or attached to awareness of others?\n",
            "Though none of these questions are fully answerable at this time, research into anosognosia has provided scientists and philosophers with insight into some of these ancient questions of human consciousness.\n",
            "The question of “denial” versus “unawareness” is at the heart of debate between psychologists and neurologists about the origin of anosognosia.\n",
            "Proponents of a psychological explanation for the disorder insist that patients are aware on some level of their paralysis, but deny this information, as it would be traumatizing to the image of the self to admit to a lack of ability to control one’s own body.\n",
            "However, this theory is countered by the fact that anosognosia in stroke patients almost always occurs after a stroke in the right hemisphere of the brain; though a stroke in the left hemisphere is no less devastating to the body, patients with left hemisphere strokes nearly always fully recognize the impact of their strokes on their bodies.\n",
            "Another explanation of anosognosia draws on the fact that this disorder and hemiplegia are nearly always accompanied by hemispatial neglect, in which the patient does not recognize or attend to visual information on the side of the visual field contralateral to the brain damage.\n",
            "Some researchers believe that since right-brain stroke patients can be inattentive to visual information on the left side, they may simply be displaying the same inattention to the left half of their bodies when they have anosognosia.\n",
            "In other words, if one pays no attention to the left arm, one would not notice if the left arm is doing something odd, like not moving.\n",
            "However, one of the premier experts on anosognosia, Dr. Vilayanur Ramachandran, has pointed out a key flaw in this theory: though hemispatial neglect patients with right brain damage acknowledge seeing stimuli presented to the left visual field if it is brought to their attention, for example by being moved or set on fire, no amount of attention drawn to an anosognosiac’s immobile limbs will make her acknowledge that her limb is paralyzed.\n",
            "Generally the anosognosiac will insist that her limb is moving.\n",
            "If pressed, she will cite her arthritis or a lack of motivation as a reason for her immobility.\n",
            "When forced, the patient may even venture completely out of the realm of reality in defending her ability to move, stating that the immobile limb belongs to someone else, or is not a limb at all.\n",
            "Dr. Edoardo Bisiach, another expert in the field, once saw a patient who claimed that his paralyzed hand belonged to Bisiach himself.\n",
            "When Bisiach held his own two hands together with the patient’s immobile hand, and asked how it was possible that he had three hands, the patient calmly replied, “A hand is the extremity of an arm.\n",
            "Since you have three arms, it follows that you must have three hands”.\n",
            "Ramachandran insists that this type of unrealistic rationalization is particular to patients with anosognosia; a patient suffering only from hemispatial neglect will not justify her beliefs with peculiar stories, but will accept a doctor’s diagnosis.\n",
            "Ramachandran favors an explanation of anosognosia dependent on both psychology and neurology.\n",
            "He maintains that due to the vast amount of sensory information the brain regularly receives, it must have a filter of some sort that lets it process only important\n",
            "information.\n",
            "Ramachandran’s idea is that the left hemisphere of the brain contains a schema of the body in its entirety, which is updated as needed by a section of the right hemisphere.\n",
            "This right hemisphere function compares incoming sensory information to the left-brain schema, and decides which discrepancies are worth informing the left-brain about.\n",
            "For instance, while a few sneezes can be brushed off, a fever will bring the right brain to inform the left-brain that one is sick.\n",
            "Not all discrepancies in information change the left-brain’s schematic representation of the body, but the most important or startling ones do.\n",
            "Ramachandran believes that the right brain’s ability to detect these discrepancies is damaged in patients with anosognosia.\n",
            "Thus, the left-brain receives no information about a change in the body’s ability to move, and the current representation of the body as fully mobile is maintained.\n",
            "Current experiments have shown that if any information of a change in the body’s abilities is present in anosognosiacs, it is extraordinarily inaccessible to the I-function.\n",
            "Ramachandran asked three hemiplegic anosognosiacs and two stroke victims with hemiplegia and no anosognosia to choose between winning a small prize for completing a task involving one hand (i.e., stacking blocks) and winning a large prize for completing a task involving two hands (i.e., tying a bow).\n",
            "The hemiplegics with no anosognosia consistently opted for the smaller prize.\n",
            "However, the hemiplegic anosognosiacs chose repeatedly to attempt the two handed task, never learning from their failures, and never recognizing their limitations.\n",
            "Amazingly, many anosognosiacs also seem unable to recognize their own limitations in other people.\n",
            "In a recent experiment, Ramachandran found that two thirds of tested hemiplegic anosognosiacs were not able to recognize paralysis in another person.\n",
            "He suggests that this is because we have a schema for the bodies of others as well as ourselves, and that they are represented in close proximity in our brains.\n",
            "This idea was supported by recent research with monkeys, which exhibited that the same areas that were active when a monkey completed a certain task were also active when he watched another monkey complete the same task.\n",
            "This information suggests that selfawareness is crucial in awareness of others.\n",
            "However, this research is in its early stages, and has not yet been used in the treatment of anosognosiacs.\n",
            "Two methods of treatment, one primitive and one modern, are used currently to help bring a sense of awareness of failure to anosognosiacs.\n",
            "The first method, invented by Bisiach, involves pouring cold water in the ear of the patient on the side of the paralysis.\n",
            "Since nerves in the ear contribute information about the body’s balance to the brain, Bisiach figured by shocking these nerves he might startle the part of the body liable for updating the body schema with new information.\n",
            "This appears to work astonishingly well; patients undergoing this treatment often fully realize their paralysis for several hours.\n",
            "The second method of treatment uses virtual reality programming to give patients repeated feedback about their failures in a safe setting.\n",
            "This kind of program helped I.S., a man with anosognosia for hemispatial neglect, without hemiplegia.\n",
            "I.S.\n",
            "was determined to drive, and saw no reason why he should not, until he was treated with a virtual reality program simulating street crossing.\n",
            "Since I.S.\n",
            "did not pay attention to cars coming on his left side, he consistently had “accidents”, which caused the program to make crashing noises and flash warnings.\n",
            "This type of confrontation with his limitations seemed to cause I.S.\n",
            "to start trusting his doctors over his own sense of self.\n",
            "Presumably, the shock of knowing that if he followed the information given to his I-function by the rest of his brain, he would die, caused him to realize that he needed to learn new ways to perceive himself and the world around him, perhaps even by trusting others over himself.\n",
            "The issue of trust stands out as key in anosognosia, a disorder in which the patient can no longer trust her own information about herself.\n",
            "This seems almost unthinkable, hence the reason I chose to open this essay by addressing you, the reader.\n",
            "Could you possibly believe someone else’s information about your body over\n",
            "your own?\n",
            "And, if you ever learned to survive as someone who could no longer trust your brain (and, thus, yourself), could you ever again have any type of free will?\n",
            "Could you be creative or original without fully believing in your own mind?\n",
            "The fact that free will is so hard to imagine without an intact sense of self makes me appreciate the seemingly ridiculous lengths to which anosognosiacs will go to defend their perceptions.\n",
            "In regard to anosognosia for neurological patients, no longterm treatments exist.\n",
            "As with unilateral neglect, caloric reflex testing (squirting ice cold water into the left ear) is known to temporarily ameliorate unawareness of impairment.\n",
            "It is not entirely clear how this works, although it is thought that the unconscious shift of attention or focus caused by the intense stimulation of the vestibular system temporarily influences awareness.\n",
            "Most cases of anosognosia appear to simply disappear over time, while other cases can last indefinitely.\n",
            "Normally, long-term cases are treated with cognitive therapy to train the patient to adjust for their inoperable limbs (though it is believed that these patients still are not “aware” of their disability).\n",
            "Another commonly used method is the use of feedback – comparing clients’ selfpredicted performance with their actual performance on a task in an attempt to improve insight.\n",
            "Neurorehabilitation is difficult because, as anosognosia impairs the patient’s desire to seek medical aid, it may also impair their ability to seek rehabilitation.\n",
            "A lack of awareness of the deficit makes cooperative, mindful work with a therapist difficult.\n",
            "In the acute phase, very little can be done to improve their awareness, but during this time, it is important for the therapist to build a therapeutic alliance with patients by entering their phenomenological field and reducing their frustration and confusion.\n",
            "Since severity changes over time, no single method of treatment or rehabilitation has emerged or will likely emerge.\n",
            "With regard to psychiatric patients, empirical studies verify that, for individuals with severe mental illnesses, lack of awareness of illness is significantly associated with both medication noncompliance and re-hospitalization.\n",
            "Fifteen percent of individuals with severe mental illnesses who refuse to take medication voluntarily under any circumstances may require some form of coercion to remain compliant because of anosognosia.\n",
            "Coercive psychiatric treatment is a delicate and complex legal and ethical issue.\n",
            "One study of voluntary and involuntary inpatients confirmed that committed patients require coercive treatment because they fail to recognize their need for care.\n",
            "The patients committed to the hospital had significantly lower measures of insight than the voluntary patients.\n",
            "Anosognosia is also closely related to other cognitive dysfunctions that may impair the capacity of an individual to continuously participate in treatment.\n",
            "Other research has suggested that attitudes toward treatment can improve after involuntary treatment and that previously committed patients tend later to seek voluntary treatment.\n",
            "Apraxia is a poorly understood neurological condition.\n",

            "They are able to explain how to perform an action, but unable to “imagine” or act out a movement such as “pretend to brush your teeth” or “pucker as though you bit into a sour lemon.”\n",

            "Consists of an inability to select and carry out an appropriate motor program.\n",
            "For instance, the patient may complete actions in incorrect orders, such as buttering bread before putting it in the toaster, or putting on shoes before putting on socks.\n",

            "For instance, if given a screwdriver, the patient may try to write with it as if it were a pen, or try to comb his hair with a toothbrush.\n",
            "• Buccofacial or orofacial apraxia: Non-verbal oral or buccofacial ideomotor apraxia resulting in difficulty carrying out movements of the face on demand.\n",
            "For instance, an inability to lick one’s lips or whistle.\n",
            "This is an ability to carry out any volitional movements of the tongue, cheeks, lips, pharynx, or larynx on command.\n",
            "• Constructional apraxia: The inability to draw or construct simple configurations, such as intersecting shapes.\n",
            "• Gait apraxia: The loss of ability to have normal function of the lower limbs such as walking.\n",
            "This is not due to loss of motor or sensory functions.\n",
            "• Limb-kinetic apraxia: Difficulty making precise movements with an arm or leg.\n",
            "• Oculomotor apraxia: Difficulty moving the eye, particularly with saccade movements that direct the gaze to targets.\n",
            "This is one of the 3 major components of Balint’s syndrome.\n",
            "Each kind may be tested at decreasing levels of complexity; if the person tested fails to execute the commands, you can make the movement yourself and ask that the person mimic it, or you can even give them a real object (like a toothbrush) and ask them to use it.\n",
            "Apraxia of speech (AOS) is a neurologic speech disorder that reflects an impaired capacity to plan or program sensorimotor commands necessary for directing movements that result in phonetically and prosodically normal speech.\n",
            "It takes in both children (childhood apraxia of speech) and adults (acquired apraxia of speech) who have (prior to the onset of apraxia) acquired some level of speaking ability.\n",
            "AOS affects an individual’s volitional speech and is typically the result of a stroke, tumor, or other known neurological illness or injury.\n",
            "Apraxia may be accompanied by a language disorder called aphasia.\n",
            "Symptoms of AOS include inconsistent articulatory errors, groping oral movements to locate the correct articulatory position, and increasing errors with increasing word and phrase length.\n",
            "Individuals with apraxia of speech know what words they want to say, but their brains have difficulty coordinating the muscle movements necessary to say all the sounds in the words.\n",
            "Patients with apraxia find that vowels are easier to produce than consonants.\n",
            "Single consonants are easier than blends.\n",
            "As in stuttering, final consonants are easier than those in the initial position.\n",
            "This may occur because initial consonants are affected by anticipatory errors.\n",
            "Also, perhaps once a person with apraxia\n",
            "begins speech with the production of a vowel, production continues in a more automatic fashion.\n",
            "Fricative and affricates are the most difficult phonemes for apraxics to produce.\n",
            "AOS often co-occurs with Oral Apraxia, which is the inability to perform volitional tasks with the oral structures not involving speech.\n",
            "Some of these tasks might include coughing, puckering the lips, and smiling.\n",
            "AOS also often co-occurs with Limb Apraxia.\n",
            "Developmental verbal dyspraxia presents in children who have no evidence of difficulty with strength or range of motion of the articulators, but are unable to execute speech movements because of motor planning and coordination problems.\n",
            "Apraxia is caused by damage to the brain.\n",
            "When apraxia develops in a person who was previously able to perform the tasks or abilities, it is called acquired apraxia.\n",
            "The very common causes of acquired apraxia are:\n",
            "• Brain tumor\n",
            "• Condition that causes gradual worsening of the brain and nervous system (neurodegenerative illness)\n",
            "• Dementia\n",
            "• Stroke\n",
            "• Traumatic brain injury\n",
            "Apraxia may also be seen at birth.\n",
            "Symptoms appear as the child grows and develops.\n",
            "The cause is unknown.\n",
            "Apraxia of speech is often present along with another speech disorder called aphasia.\n",
            "Depending on the cause of apraxia, a number of other brain or nervous system problems may be present.\n",
            "Apraxia is most often due to a lesion located in the left hemisphere of the brain, typically in the frontal and parietal lobes.\n",
            "Lesions may be because of stroke, acquired brain injuries, or neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease or other dementias, Parkinson’s disease, or Huntington’s disease.\n",
            "It is also possible for apraxia to be caused by lesions in other areas of the brain including the right hemisphere.\n",
            "Ideomotor apraxia is typically due to a decrease in blood flow to the left hemisphere of the brain and particularly the parietal and premotor areas.\n",
            "It is frequently seen in patients with corticobasal degeneration.\n",
            "Ideational apraxia often results in functional impairments in activities of daily living (ADLs) similar to those seen with late stage dementia.\n",
            "In very recent past, it has been observed in patients with lesions in the left hemisphere near areas associated with aphasia; however, more research is needed on ideational apraxia due to brain lesions.\n",
            "The localization of lesions in areas of the frontal and temporal lobes would provide explanation for the difficulty in motor planning seen in ideational apraxia as well as its difficulty to distinguish it from certain aphasias.\n",
            "Constructional apraxia is generally caused by lesions of the inferior right parietal lobe, and can be caused by brain injury, illness, tumor or other condition that can result in a brain lesion.\n",
            "Although qualitative and quantitative studies exist, there is little consensus on the proper method to assess for apraxia.\n",
            "The criticisms of past methods include failure to meet standard psychometric properties as well as research-specific designs that translate poorly to non-research use.\n",
            "The Test to Measure Upper Limb Apraxia (TULIA) is one method of determining upper limb apraxia through the qualitative and quantitative assessment of gesture production.\n",
            "In contrast to previous publications on apraxic assessment, the reliability and validity of TULIA was thoroughly investigated.\n",
            "The TULIA consists of subtests for the imitation and pantomime of non-symbolic (“put your index finger on top of your nose”), intransitive (“wave goodbye”) and transitive (“show me how to use a hammer”) gestures.Discrimination (differentiating between well- and poorly performed tasks) and recognition (indicating which object corresponds to a pantomimed gesture) tasks are also often tested for a full apraxia evaluation.\n",
            "However, there may not be a strong correlation between formal test results and actual\n",
            "performance in everyday functioning or activities of daily living (ADLs).\n",
            "A comprehensive assessment of apraxia should include formal testing, standardized measurements of ADLs, observation of daily routines, self-report questionnaires and targeted interviews with the patients and their relatives.\n",
            "As said above, apraxia should not be confused with aphasia, however they are frequently accompanied with each other.\n",
            "It has been said that apraxia is so often accompanied by aphasia that many believe that if a person displays AOS; it should be assumed that the patient also has some level of aphasia.\n",
            "People with apraxia may benefit from treatment by a health care team.\n",
            "The team should also include family members.\n",
            "Occupational and speech therapists may help both patients and their caregivers learn ways to deal with the apraxia.\n",
            "Because patients with apraxia have trouble following instructions, therapists who are experienced in treating this disorder may have better results.\n",
            "Speech and language treatment may include:\n",
            "• Repeating sounds over and over to teach mouth movements\n",
            "• Slowing down the person’s speech\n",
            "• Teaching different techniques to help with communication\n",
            "Recognition and treatment of depression is important for people with severe speech and language disorders.\n",
            "• Maintain a relaxed, calm environment.\n",
            "• Take time to show someone with apraxia how to do a task, and allow enough time for them to do so.\n",
            "Do not ask them to repeat the task if they are clearly struggling with it and doing so will increase frustration.\n",
            "• Suggest alternative ways to do the same things.\n",
            "For example, try a hook and loop closure instead of laces for shoes.\n",
            "When speech apraxia is present:\n",
            "• Avoid giving complex directions.\n",
            "• Use simple phrases to avoid misunderstandings.\n",
            "• Speak in a normal tone of voice.\n",
            "Speech apraxia is not a hearing problem.\n",
            "• Do not assume that the person understands.\n",
            "• Provide communication aids, if possible, depending on the person and condition.\n",
            "Treatment for individuals with apraxia includes speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy.\n",
            "Yet, treatments for apraxia have received little attention for several reasons, including the tendency for the condition to resolve spontaneously in acute cases.\n",
            "Besides, the very nature of the automatic-voluntary dissociation of motor abilities that defines apraxia means that patients may still be able to automatically perform activities if cued to do so in daily life.\n",
            "Nevertheless, research shows that patients experiencing apraxia have less functional independence in their daily lives, and that evidence for the treatment of apraxia is scarce.\n",
            "However, a literature review of apraxia treatment to date reveals that although the field is in its early stages of treatment design, certain aspects can be included to treat apraxia.\n",
            "One method is through rehabilitative treatment, which has been found to positively impact apraxia, as well as activities of daily living.\n",
            "In this review, rehabilitative treatment consisted of 12 different contextual cues, which were used in order to teach patients how to produce the same gesture under different contextual situations.\n",
            "Extra studies have also recommended varying forms of gesture therapy, whereby the patient is instructed to make gestures (either using objects or symbolically meaningful and non-meaningful gestures) with progressively less cuing from the therapist.\n",
            "It may be necessary for patients with apraxia to use a form of alternative and augmentative communication depending on the severity of the disorder.\n",
            "Beside to using gestures as mentioned, patients can also use communication boards or more\n",
            "sophisticated electronic devices if needed.\n",
            "No single type of therapy or approach has been proven as the best way to treat a patient with apraxia, since each patient’s case varies.\n",
            "However, one-on- one sessions usually work the best, with the support of family members and friends.\n",
            "Since everyone responds to therapy differently, some patients will make significant improvements, while others will make less progress.\n",
            "The overall aim for treatment of apraxia is to treat the motor plans for speech, not treating at the phoneme (sound) level.\n",
            "Dementia is not a specific disease.\n",
            "It’s an overall term that describes a wide range of symptomsassociated with a decline in memory or other thinking skills severe enough to reduce a person’s ability to perform everyday activities.Alzheimer’s disease accounts for 60 to 80 percent of cases.Vascular dementia, which occurs after a stroke, is the second most common dementia type.\n",
            "But there are several other conditions that can cause symptoms of dementia, including some that are reversible, like thyroid problems and vitamin deficiencies.\n",
            "Dementia is often incorrectly referred to as “senility” or “senile dementia,” which reflects the formerly widespread but incorrect belief that serious mental decline is a normal part of aging.\n",
            "Dementia, also known as senility, is a broad category of brain diseases that cause a long term and often gradual decrease in the ability to think and remember that is great enough to affect a person’s daily functioning.\n",
            "Other common symptoms include emotional problems, problems with language, and a decrease in motivation.\n",
            "A person’s consciousness is not affected.\n",
            "A dementia diagnosis needs a change from a person’s usual mental functioning and a greater decline than one would expect due to aging.\n",
            "These diseases also have a significant effect on a person’s caregivers.\n",
            "The most common type of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease, which makes up 50% to 70% of cases.\n",
            "Other common types includevascular dementia (25%), Lewy body dementia (15%), and frontotemporal dementia.\n",
            "Less common causes needs normal pressure hydrocephalus, Parkinson’s disease, syphilis, and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease among others.\n",

            "A small proportion of cases run in families.\n",
            "In the DSM-5, dementia was reclassified as a neurocognitive disorder, with various degrees of severity.\n",
            "Diagnosis is generally based on history of the illness and cognitive testing with medical imaging and blood work used to rule out other possible causes.\n",
            "The mini mental state examination is one commonly used cognitive test.\n",
            "Efforts to prevent dementia include trying to decrease risk factors such as high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, and obesity.\n",
            "Screening the general population for the disease is not recommended.\n",
            "There is no cure for dementia.\n",
            "Cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil are often used and may be beneficial in mild to moderate disease.\n",
            "Overall benefit, however, may be minor.\n",
            "For people with dementia and those who care for them many measures can improve their lives.\n",
            "Cognitive and behavioural interventions may be appropriate.\n",
            "Educating and providing emotional support to the caregiver is important.\n",
            "Exercise programs are beneficial with respect to activities of daily living and potentially improve outcomes.\n",
            "Treatment of behavioural problems or psychosis due to dementia with antipsychotics is common but not usually recommended due to there often being little benefit and an increased risk of death.\n",
            "Globally, dementia affects 36 million people.\n",
            "About 10% of people develop the disease at some point in their lives.\n",
            "It becomes more common with age.\n",
            "About 3% of people between the ages of 65– 74 have dementia, 19% between 75 and 84 and nearly half of those over 85 years of age.\n",
            "In 2013 dementia resulted in about 1.7 million deaths up from 0.8 million in 1990.\n",
            "As more people are living longer, dementia is becoming more common in the population as a whole.\n",
            "For people of a specific age, however, it may be becoming less frequent, at least in the developed world, due to a decrease in risk factors.\n",
            "It is one of the most common causes of disability\n",
            "among the old.\n",
            "It is believed to result in economic costs of 604 billion USD a year.\n",
            "People with dementia are often physically or chemically restrained to a greater degree than necessary, raising issues of human rights.\n",
            "Social stigma against those affected is common.\n",
            "The symptoms of dementia are of different types and stages of the diagnosis.\n",
            "The most common affected areas include memory, visual-spatial, language, attention and problem solving.\n",
            "Most types of dementia are slow and progressive.\n",
            "By the time the person shows signs of the disease, the process in the brain has been happening for a long time.\n",
            "It is possible for a patient to have two types of dementia at the same time.\n",
            "About 10% of people with dementia have what is known as mixed dementia, which is usually a combination of Alzheimer’s disease and another type of dementia such as frontotemporal dementia or vascular dementia.\n",
            "Additional psychological and behavioural problems that often affect people who have dementia comprise:\n",
            "• Balance problems\n",
            "• Tremor\n",
            "• Speech and language difficulty\n",
            "• Trouble eating or swallowing\n",
            "• Memory distortions (believing that a memory has already happened when it has not, thinking an old memory is a new one, combining two memories, or confusing the people in a memory)\n",
            "• Wandering or restlessness\n",
            "• Perception and visual problems\n",
            "• Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) almost always occur in all types of dementia.\n",

            "• Depression\n",
            "• Anxiety • Abnormal motor behaviour • Elated mood • Irritability • Apathy • Disinhibition and impulsivity • Delusions (often believing people are stealing from them) or hallucinations • Changes in sleep or appetite.\n",
            "When people with dementia are put in circumstances beyond their abilities, there may be a sudden change to crying or anger (a”catastrophic reaction”). Depression affects 20–30% of people who have dementia, and about 20% have anxiety.\n",
            "Psychosis (often delusions of persecution) and agitation/aggression also often accompany dementia.\n",
            "Each of these must be assessed and treated independently of the underlying dementia.\n",
            "In the first stages of dementia, the signs and symptoms of the disease may be subtle.\n",
            "Often, the early signs of dementia only become apparent when looking back in time.\n",
            "The earliest stage of dementia is called mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\n",
            "70% of those diagnosed with MCI progress to dementia at some point.\n",
            "In MCI, changes in the person’s brain have been happening for a long time, but the symptoms of the disease are just beginning to show.\n",
            "These problems, however, are not yet severe enough to affect the person’s daily function.\n",
            "If they do, it is considered dementia.\n",
            "A person with MCI scores between 27 and 30 on the MiniMental State Examination (MMSE), which is a normal score.\n",
            "They may have some memory trouble and trouble finding words, but they solve everyday problems and handle their own life affairs well.\n",
            "In the early stage of dementia, the person begins to show symptoms noticeable to the people around them.\n",
            "In addition, the\n",
            "symptoms begin to interfere with daily activities.\n",
            "The person usually scores between a 20 and 25 on the MMSE.\n",
            "The symptoms are dependent on the type of dementia a person has.\n",
            "The person may initiate to have difficulty with more complicated chores and tasks around the house.\n",
            "The person can usually still take care of him or herself but may forget things like taking pills or doing laundry and may need prompting or reminders.\n",
            "The symptoms of early dementia usually include memory difficulty, but can also include some word-finding problems (anomia) and problems with planning and organizational skills (executive function).\n",
            "One very good way of assessing a person’s impairment is by asking if he or she is still able to handle his/her finances independently.\n",
            "This is often one of the first things to become problematic.\n",
            "Other signs might be getting lost in new places, repeating things, personality changes, social withdrawal and difficulties at work.\n",
            "When evaluating a person for dementia, it is important to consider how the person was able to function five or ten years earlier.\n",
            "It is also important to consider a person’s level of education when assessing for loss of function.\n",
            "For instance, an accountant who can no longer balance a checkbook would be more concerning than a person who had not finished high school or had never taken care of his/her own finances.\n",
            "In Alzheimer’s dementia the most prominent early symptom is memory difficulty.\n",
            "Others include word-finding problems and getting lost.\n",
            "In other kinds of dementia, like dementia with Lewy bodies and fronto-temporal dementia, personality changes and difficulty with organization and planning may be the first signs.\n",
            "As dementia progresses, the symptoms first experienced in the early stages of the dementia generally worsen.\n",
            "The rate of decline is different for each person.\n",
            "A person with moderate dementia scores between 6-17 on the MMSE.\n",
            "For instance, people with Alzheimer’s dementia in the moderate stages lose almost all new information very quickly.\n",
            "Dementia sufferers may be severely impaired in solving problems, and their social judgment is generally also impaired.\n",
            "They cannot generally function outside their own home, and generally should not be left alone.\n",
            "They may be able to do simple chores around the house but not much else, and begin to require assistance for personal care and hygiene other than simple reminders.\n",
            "People with late-stage dementia typically turn increasingly inward and need assistance with most or all of their personal care.\n",
            "Persons with dementia in the late stages generally need 24-hour supervision to ensure personal safety, as well as to ensure that basic needs are being met.\n",
            "If left unsupervised, a person with latestage dementia may wander and fall, may not recognize common dangers around them such as a hot stove, may not realize that they need to use the bathroom or become unable to control their bladder or bowels (incontinent).\n",
            "Changes in eating frequently occur, and those with late-stage dementia often need pureed diets, thickened liquids, and assistance in eating.\n",
            "Their appetite may decline to the point that the person does not want to eat at all.\n",
            "He or she may not want to get out of bed, or may need complete assistance doing so.\n",
            "They may no longer recognize familiar people.\n",
            "He or she may have significant changes in sleeping habits or have trouble sleeping at all.\n",
            "Dementia is caused by damage to brain cells.\n",
            "This damage interferes with the ability of brain cells to communicate with each other.\n",
            "When brain cells cannot communicate normally, thinking, behaviour and feelings can be affected.\n",
            "The brain has many distinct regions, each of which is responsible for different functions (for example, memory, judgment and movement).\n",
            "When cells in a particular region are damaged, that region cannot carry out its functions normally.\n",
            "Various kinds of dementia are associated with particular types of brain cell damage in particular regions of the brain.\n",
            "For example,\n",
            "in Alzheimer’s disease, high levels of certain proteins inside and outside brain cells make it hard for brain cells to stay healthy and to communicate with each other.\n",
            "The brain region called the hippocampus is the center of learning and memory in the brain, and the brain cells in this region are often the first to be damaged.\n",
            "That’s why memory loss is generally one of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer’s. While most changes in the brain that cause dementia are permanent and worsen over time, thinking and memory problems caused by the following conditions may improve when the condition is treated or addressed:\n",
            "• Depression\n",
            "• Medication side effects\n",
            "• Excess use of alcohol\n",
            "• Thyroid problems\n",
            "• Vitamin deficiencies\n",
            "There are four main causes of easily reversible dementia: hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 deficiency, Lyme disease, and neurosyphillis.\n",
            "All people with memory difficulty should be checked for hypothyroidism and B12 deficiency.\n",
            "For Lyme disease and neurosyphilis, testing should be done if there are risk factors for those diseases in the person.\n",
            "Alzheimer’s disease accounts for up to 50% to 70% of cases of dementia.\n",
            "The most common symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease are short-term memory loss and word-finding difficulties.\n",
            "People with Alzheimer’s also have trouble with visual-spatial areas (for instance they may begin to get lost often), reasoning, judgment, and insight.\n",

            "Vascular dementia is the cause of at least 20% of dementia cases, making it the second most common cause of dementia.\n",
            "It is caused by disease or injury to blood vessels that damage the brain, including strokes.\n",
            "The symptoms of this dementia depend on where in the brain the strokes have occurred and whether the vessels are large or small.\n",
            "Multiple injuries can cause progressive dementia over time, while a single injury located in an area critical for cognition (i.e. hippocampus, thalamus) can lead to sudden cognitive decline.\n",

            "In bv-FTD, the person shows a change in personal hygiene, becomes rigid in their thinking, and rarely recognize that there is a problem, they are socially withdrawn, and often have a drastic increase in appetite.\n",
            "They may also be socially inappropriate.\n",
            "For instance, they may make inappropriate sexual comments, or may begin using pornography openly when they had not before.\n",
            "One of the most common signs is apathy, or not caring about anything.\n",
            "Apathy, however, is a common symptom in many different dementias.\n",
            "The other two types of FTD feature language problems as the main symptom.\n",
            "The second type is called semantic dementia or temporal variant dementia (TV-FTD).\n",
            "The main feature of this is the loss of the meaning of words.\n",
            "It may begin with difficulty naming things.\n",
            "The person eventually may also lose the meaning of objects as well.\n",
            "For instance, a drawing of a bird, dog, and an airplane in someone with FTD may all appear just about the same.\n",
            "In a classic test for this, a patient is shown a picture of a pyramid and below there is a picture of both a palm tree and a pine tree.\n",
            "The person is asked to say which one goes best with the pyramid.\n",
            "In TV-FTD the person would not be able to answer that question.\n",

            "Eventually, someone with PNFA only uses one-syllable words or may become totally mute.\n",
            "With both TV-FTD and PNFA the symptoms of behaviour may be present, but milder and later than in bv-FTD.\n",

            "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a form of dementia that is characterized by problems with eye movements.\n",
            "Generally the problems begin with difficulty moving the eyes up and/or down (vertical gaze palsy).\n",
            "Since difficulty moving the eyes upward can sometimes happen in normal aging, problems with downward eye movements are the key in PSP.\n",
            "Other key symptoms of PSP include falls backwards, balance problems, slow movements, rigid muscles, irritability, apathy, social withdrawal, and depression.\n",
            "The person may also have\n",
            "certain “frontal lobe signs” such as perseveration, a grasp reflex and utilization behaviour (the need to use an object once you see it).\n",
            "People with PSP often have progressive difficulty eating and swallowing, and eventually with talking as well.\n",
            "Because of the rigidity and slow movements, PSP is sometimes misdiagnosed as Parkinson’s disease.\n",

            "One common sign is difficulty with using only one limb.\n",
            "One symptom that is extremely rare in any condition other than corticobasal degeneration is the “alien limb.”\n",
            "The alien limb is a limb of the person that seems to have a mind of its own, it moves without control of the person’s brain.\n",
            "Other common symptoms include jerky movements of one or more limbs (myoclonus), symptoms that are different in different limbs (asymmetric), difficulty with speech that is due to not being able to move the mouth muscles in a coordinated way, numbness and tingling of the limbs and neglecting one side of the person’s vision or senses.\n",
            "In neglect, a person ignores the opposite side of the body from the one that has the problem.\n",
            "For example, a person may not feel pain on one side, or may only draw half of a picture when asked.\n",
            "Besides, the person’s affected limbs may be rigid or have muscle contractions causing strange repetitive movements (dystonia).\n",
            "The area of the brain most often affected in corticobasal degeneration is the posterior frontal lobe and parietal lobe.\n",
            "Still, several other part of the brain can be affected.\n",

            "There are many other medical and neurological conditions in which dementia only occurs late in the illness.\n",
            "For example, a proportion of patients with Parkinson’s diseasedevelop dementia, though widely varying figures are quoted for this proportion.\n",
            "When dementia occurs in Parkinson’s disease, the underlying cause may bedementia with Lewy bodies or Alzheimer’s disease, or both.\n",
            "Cognitive impairment also occurs in the Parkinson-plus syndromes of progressive supranuclear palsy andcorticobasal degeneration (and the same underlying pathology may cause the clinical syndromes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration).\n",

            "Dementia that begins gradually and worsens progressively over many years is generally caused by neurodegenerative disease—that is, by conditions that affect only or primarily the neurons of the brain and cause gradual but irreversible loss of function of these cells.\n",
            "Less commonly, a non-degenerative condition may have secondary effects on brain cells, which may or may not be reversible if the condition is treated.\n",
            "Causes of dementia depend on the age when symptoms begin.\n",

            "In young adults (up to 40 years of age) who were previously of normal intelligence, it is very rare to develop dementia without other features of neurological disease, or without features of disease elsewhere in the body.\n",
            "Most cases of progressive cognitive disturbance in this age group are caused by psychiatric illness, alcohol or other drugs, or metabolic disturbance.\n",

            "Doctors can determine that a person has dementia with a high level of certainty.\n",
            "But it’s harder to determine the exact type of dementia because the symptoms and brain changes of different dementias can overlap.\n",

            "Delirium is characterized by a sudden onset, fluctuating course, a short duration (often lasting from hours to weeks), and is primarily related to a somatic (or medical) disturbance.\n",
            "In comparison, dementia has typically a long, slow onset (except in the cases of a stroke or trauma), slow decline of mental functioning, as well as a longer duration (from months to years).\n",
            "Some mental illnesses, including depression and psychosis, may produce symptoms that must be differentiated from both delirium and dementia.\n",
            "Therefore, any dementia evaluation should include a depression screening such as the Neuropsychiatric Inventory or the Geriatric Depression Scale.\n",
            "Physicians used to think that anyone who came in with memory complaints had depression and not dementia (because they thought that those with dementia are generally unaware of their memory problems).\n",
            "This is called pseudodementia.\n",
            "However, in recent past researchers have realized that many older people with memory complaints in fact have MCI, the earliest stage of dementia.\n",

            "The MOCA has also been shown somewhat better at detecting mild cognitive impairment than the MMSE.\n",
            "Another approach to screening for dementia is to ask an informant (relative or other supporter) to fill out a questionnaire about the person’s everyday cognitive functioning.\n",

            "Neurophysiologists examine the many ways in which brain activities impact nervous system activities.\n",
            "Much of the field’s work is investigative, with doctors seeking to understand the origins of and best treatments for a variety of neurological disorders.\n",
            "There are two parts to the human nervous system: the central nervous system, which is the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which is the network of nerves that extends throughout the entire body.\n",
            "Nerves are\n",
            "responsible for sensitivity and feeling, but also muscle health and control.\n",
            "Neurophysiology examines the relationship between the two systems in causing degenerative diseases like multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease, as well as neurological disorders like epilepsy.\n",
            "Neurophysiology is a branch of physiology that focuses on the study of the central nervous system (CNS).\n",
            "While physiology is the broad study of the mechanisms of how cells, muscles and organs work together and how they interact, neurophysiology is much narrower.\n",
            "One of the main diagnostic tools used in neurophysiology is electroencephalography (EEG).\n",
            "The original tool, while later refined and augmented by other tools, was originally developed in 1929 by German psychiatrist, Hans Berger.\n",
            "It was a milestone in the development of neuroscience and in the practice of neurology, specially related to epilepsy.\n",
            "Generally, the EEG is a direct measure of electrical energies in the brain.\n",
            "It is generally recorded at the scalp surface and reflects the moment-to-moment electrical activity of the brain.\n",
            "The electrical activity is produced by the synaptic currents that arise on the dendrites and cell bodies of billions of cortical cells that are usually only a few centimeters below the scalp.\n",
            "It can also be a measure of damage of electrical networks in the brain that are disturbed by traumatic brain injuries (TBI).\n",
            "The most consistent findings in this regard are:\n",
            "• Reduced power in the higher frequency bands (8-49 Hz) which is directly related to the degree of injury to cortical gray matter of the brain.\n",
            "The gray matter routes sensory or motor stimuli to the central nervous system to create a response to the stimulus through chemical synaptic activity;\n",
            "• Increased slow waves in the delta frequency bands (1-4 Hz) occurs in the more severe cases of TBI.\n",
            "This is directly related to the magnitude of damage to the cerebral white matter as the increase in delta waves are often associated with, inter alia, certain neurological disorders;\n",
            "• Changes in delta frequency bands and EEG phase delays that are directly related to both the gray and the white matter, especially when the temporal and frontal lobes are involved.\n",
            "Clinical and validation studies performed on EEG results have shown a high correlation between them and clinical measures such as neuropsychological test performance, Glasgow coma scores, length of coma and MRI biophysical measures.\n",
            "There are several other tests that are associated with the field of neurophysiology.\n",
            "These comp0rise:\n",
            "• Nerve conduction study: Measures electrical signals in the nerves, primarily in the arms and legs.\n",
            "Small electrical shocks are administered to the skin over the nerve.\n",
            "It is typically done to determine if there is damage to the peripheral nervous system, that includes all nerves that lead away from the brain and spinal cord and the smaller nerves that branch out from the main nerves;\n",
            "• Electromyogram (EMG): Measures the activity of muscles while at rest and while contracted and in so doing, measured how fast the nerves send electrical messages to the brain.\n",
            "While the test does not show brain or spinal cord disease, it is useful in finding the cause of paralysis or weakness, or diseases of muscles, nerves or the junction of them.\n",
            "When the brain, its constituent parts and those parts of the body that directly and indirectly interact with it work and connect properly, usually all is well.\n",
            "However, when traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, strokes and various other difficult and challenging diagnoses arise after acute intervention, neurobehavioural and specialized neurorehabilitative services and other clinically relevant types of care are needed to restore the independence of the client.\n",

            "In this perspective the neuronal correlates of consciousness may be viewed as its causes, and consciousness may be thought of as a statedependent property of some undefined complex, adaptive, and highly interconnected biological system.Discovering and characterizing neural correlates does not offer a theory of consciousness that can explain how particular systems experience anything at all, or how and why they are associated with consciousness, the so-called hard problem of consciousness, but understanding the NCC may be a step toward such a theory.\n",
            "Most neurobiologists assume that the variables giving rise to consciousness are to be found at the neuronal level, governed by classical physics, though a few scholars have proposed theories ofquantum consciousness based on quantum mechanics.\n",
            "There is great explicit redundancy and parallelism in neural networks so, while activity in one group of neurons may correlate with a percept in one case, a different population might mediate a related percept if the former population is lost or inactivated.\n",

            "The growing ability of neuroscientists to manipulate neurons using methods from molecular biology in combination with optical tools (e.g., Adamantidis et al. 2007) depends on the simultaneous development of appropriate behavioural assays and model organisms amenable to large-scale genomic analysis and manipulation.\n",
            "It is the combination of such fine-grained neuronal analysis in animals with ever more sensitive psychophysical and brain imaging techniques in humans, complemented by the development of a robust theoretical predictive framework, that will hopefully lead to a rational understanding of consciousness, one of the central mysteries of life.\n",
            "There are two common but distinct dimensions of the term consciousness, one involving arousal and states of consciousness and the other involving content of consciousnessand conscious states.\n",
            "To be conscious of anything the brain must be in a relatively high state of arousal (sometimes called vigilance), whether in wakefulness or REM sleep, vividly experienced in dreams although usually not remembered.\n",
            "Brain arousal level fluctuates in a circadian rhythm but may be influenced by lack of sleep, drugs and alcohol, physical exertion, etc.\n",
            "Arousal can be measured behaviourally by the signal amplitude that triggers some criterion reaction (for example, the sound level necessary to evoke an eye movement or a head turn toward the sound source).\n",
            "Clinicians use scoring systems such as the Glasgow Coma Scale to assess the level of arousal in patients.\n",
            "High arousal states are associated with conscious states that have specific content, seeing, hearing, remembering, planning or fantasizing about something.\n",
            "Different levels or states of consciousness are associated with different kinds of conscious experiences.\n",
            "The “awake” state is quite different from the “dreaming” state (for instance, the latter has little or no self-reflection) and from the state of deep sleep.\n",
            "In all three cases the basic physiology of the brain is affected, as it also is in altered states of consciousness, for example after taking drugs or during meditation when conscious perception and insight may be enhanced compared to the normal waking state.\n",
            "Clinicians talk about impaired states of consciousness as in “the comatose state”, “the persistent vegetative state” (PVS), and “the minimally conscious state” (MCS).\n",
            "Here, “state” refers to different “amounts” of external/physical consciousness, from a total absence in coma, persistent vegetative state and general anesthesia, to a fluctuating and limited form of conscious sensation in a minimally conscious state such as sleep walking or during a complex partial epileptic seizure.\n",
            "The repertoire of conscious states or experiences accessible to a patient in a minimally conscious state is comparatively limited.\n",
            "In brain death there is no arousal, but it is unknown whether the subjectivity of experience has been interrupted, rather than its observable link with the organism.\n",
            "The potential richness of conscious experience appears to increase from deep sleep to drowsiness to full wakefulness, as might be quantified using notions from complexity theory that incorporate both the dimensionality as well as the granularity of conscious experience to give an integrated-information-theoretical account of consciousness.\n",
            "As behavioural arousal increases so does the range and complexity of possible behaviour.\n",
            "Yet in REM sleep there is a characteristic atonia, low motor arousal and the person is difficult to wake up, but there is still high metabolic and electric brain activity and vivid perception.\n",
            "Many nuclei with distinct chemical signatures in the thalamus, midbrain and pons must function for a subject to be in a sufficient state of brain arousal\n",
            "to experience anything at all.\n",
            "These nuclei therefore belong to the enabling factors for consciousness.\n",
            "Conversely it is likely that the specific content of any particular conscious sensation is mediated by particular neurons in cortex and their associated satellite structures, including the amygdala, thalamus, claustrum and the basal ganglia.\n",
            "The possibility of precisely manipulating visual percepts in time and space has made vision a preferred modality in the quest for the NCC. Psychologists have perfected a number of techniques  masking, binocular rivalry, continuous flash suppression, motion induced blindness, change blindness, inattentional blindness – in\n",
            "which the seemingly simple and unambiguous relationship between a physical stimulus in the world and its associated percept in the privacy of the subject’s mind is disrupted.\n",
            "In particular a stimulus can be perceptually suppressed for seconds or even minutes at a time: the image is projected into one of the observer’s eyes but is invisible, not seen.\n",
            "In this manner the neural mechanisms that respond to the subjective percept rather than the physical stimulus can be isolated, permitting visual consciousness to be tracked in the brain.\n",
            "In aperceptual illusion, the physical stimulus remains fixed while the percept fluctuates.\n",
            "The best known example is the Necker cube whose 12 lines can be perceived in one of two different ways in depth.\n",
            "The Necker Cube: The left line drawing can be perceived in one of two distinct depth configurations shown on the right.\n",
            "Without any other cue, the visual system flips back and forth between these two interpretations.A perceptual illusion that can be precisely controlled is binocular rivalry.\n",
            "Here, a small image, e.g., a horizontal grating, is presented to the left eye, and another image, e.g., a vertical grating, is shown to the corresponding location in the right eye.\n",
            "In spite of the constant visual stimulus, observers consciously see the horizontal grating alternate every few seconds with the vertical one.\n",
            "The brain does not allow for the simultaneous perception of both images.\n",
            "Logothetis and colleagues recorded a number of visual cortical areas in awake macaque monkeys performing a binocular rivalry task.\n",
            "Macaque monkeys can be trained to report whether they see the left or the right image.\n",
            "The distribution of the switching times and the way in which changing the contrast in one eye affects these leaves little doubt that monkeys and humans experience the same basic phenomenon.\n",
            "In the primary visual cortex (V1) only a small fraction of cells weakly modulated their response as a function of the percept of the monkey while most cells responded to one or the other retinal stimulus with little regard to what the animal perceived at the time.\n",
            "But in a high-level cortical area such as the inferior temporal cortex along the ventral stream almost all neurons responded only to the perceptually dominant stimulus, so that a “face” cell only fired when the animal indicated that it saw the face and not the pattern presented to the other eye.\n",
            "This means that NCC involve neurons active in the inferior temporal cortex: it is likely that specific reciprocal actions of neurons in the inferior temporal and parts of the prefrontal cortex are necessary.\n",
            "Many of fMRI experiments that have exploited binocular rivalry and related illusions to identify the hemodynamic activity underlying visual consciousness in humans demonstrate quite\n",
            "conclusively that BOLD activity in the upper stages of the ventral pathway (e.g., the fusiform face area and the parahippocampal place area) as well as in early regions, including V1 and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), follow the percept and not the retinal stimulus.\n",
            "Further, a number of fMRI and DTI experiments suggest V1 is necessary but not sufficient for visual consciousness.\n",
            "In a related perceptual phenomenon, flash suppression, the percept associated with an image projected into one eye is suppressed by flashing another image into the other eye while the original image remains.\n",
            "Its methodological benefit over binocular rivalry is that the timing of the perceptual transition is determined by an external trigger rather than by an internal event.\n",
            "The majority of cells in the inferior temporal cortex and the superior temporal sulcus of monkeys trained to report their percept during flash suppression follow the animal’s percept: when the cell’s preferred stimulus is perceived, the cell responds.\n",
            "If the picture is still present on the retina but is perceptually suppressed, the cell falls silent, even though primary visual cortex neurons fire.\n",
            "Single-neuron recordings in the medial temporal lobe of epilepsy patients during flash suppression likewise demonstrate abolishment of response when the preferred stimulus is present but perceptually masked.\n",
            "Given the absence of any accepted criterion of the minimal neuronal correlates necessary for consciousness, the distinction between a persistently vegetative patient who shows regular sleepwave transitions and may be able to move or smile, and a minimally conscious patient who can communicate (on occasion) in a meaningful manner (for instance, by differential eye movements) and who shows some signs of consciousness, is often difficult.\n",
            "In global anesthesia the patient should not experience psychological trauma but the level of arousal should be compatible with clinical exigencies.\n",
            "Midline structures in the brainstem and thalamus necessary to regulate the level of brain arousal.\n",
            "Small, bilateral lesions in many of these nuclei cause a global loss of consciousness.\n",
            "Blood-oxygen-level-dependent fMRI (BOLD fMRI) have demonstrated normal patterns of brain activity in a patient in a vegetative state following a severe traumatic brain injury when asked to imagine playing tennis or visiting rooms in his/her house.\n",
            "Differential brain imaging of patients with such global disturbances of consciousness (including akinetic mutism) reveal that dysfunction in a widespread cortical network including medial and lateral prefrontal and parietal associative areas is associated with a global loss of awareness.\n",
            "Impaired consciousness in epileptic seizures of the temporal lobe was likewise accompanied by a decrease in cerebral blood flow in frontal and parietal association cortex and an increase in midline structures such as the mediodorsal thalamus.Relatively local bilateral injuries to midline (paramedian) subcortical structures can also cause a complete loss of awareness.\n",
            "These structures therefore enable and control brain arousal (as determined by metabolic or electrical activity) and are necessary neural correlates.\n",
            "One such example is the heterogeneous collection of more than two dozen nuclei on each side of the upper brainstem (pons,\n",
            "midbrain and in the posterior hypothalamus), collectively referred to as the reticular activating system (RAS).\n",
            "Their axons project widely throughout the brain.\n",
            "These nuclei – three-dimensional collections of neurons with their own cyto-architecture and neurochemical identity – release distinct neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, noradrenaline/norepinephrine, serotonin, histamine and orexin/hypocretin to control the excitability of the thalamus and forebrain, mediating alternation between wakefulness and sleep as well as general level of behavioural and brain arousal.\n",
            "After such trauma, however, ultimately the excitability of the thalamus and forebrain can recover and consciousness can return.\n",
            "Another enabling factor for consciousness are the five or more intralaminar nuclei (ILN) of the thalamus.\n",
            "These receive input from many brainstem nuclei and project strongly, directly to the basal ganglia and, in a more distributed manner, into layer I of much of the neocortex.\n",
            "Comparatively small (1 cm3 or less) bilateral lesions in the thalamic ILN completely knock out all awareness.\n",
            "Many actions in response to sensory inputs are rapid, transient, stereotyped, and unconscious.\n",
            "They could be thought of as cortical reflexes and are characterized by rapid and somewhat stereotyped responses that can take the form of rather complex automated behaviour as seen, e.g., in complex partial epileptic seizures.\n",
            "These automated responses, sometimes called zombie behaviours, could be contrasted by a slower, all-purpose conscious mode that deals more slowly with broader, less stereotyped aspects of the sensory inputs (or a reflection of these, as in imagery) and takes time to decide on appropriate thoughts and responses.\n",
            "Without such a consciousness mode, a vast number of different zombie modes would be required to react to unusual events.\n",
            "A feature that distinguishes humans from most animals is that we are not born with an extensive repertoire of behavioural programs that would enable us to survive on our own (“physiological prematurity”).\n",
            "To compensate for this, we have an unmatched ability to learn, i.e., to consciously acquire such programs by imitation or exploration.\n",
            "Once consciously acquired and sufficiently exercised, these programs can become automated to the extent that their execution happens beyond the realms of our awareness.\n",
            "Take, as an example, the incredible fine motor skills exerted in playing a Beethoven piano sonata or the sensorimotor coordination required to ride a motorcycle along a curvy mountain road.\n",
            "Such complex behaviours are possible only because a an adequate number of the subprograms involved can be executed with minimal or even suspended conscious control.\n",
            "In fact, the conscious system may actually interfere somewhat with these automated programs.From an evolutionary standpoint it clearly makes sense to have both automated behavioural programs that can be executed rapidly in a stereotyped and automated manner, and a slightly slower system that allows time for thinking and planning more complex behaviour.\n",
            "This latter aspect may be one of the principal functions of consciousness.\n",
            "It appears feasible that visual zombie modes in the cortex mainly use the dorsal stream in the parietal region.\n",
            "However, parietal activity can affect consciousness by producing attentional effects on the ventral stream, at least under some circumstances.\n",
            "The conscious mode for vision depends largely on the early visual areas (beyond V1) and especially on the ventral stream.\n",
            "Seemingly complex visual processing (such as detecting animals in natural, cluttered scenes) can be accomplished by the human cortex within 130–150 ms, far too brief for eye movements and conscious perception to occur.\n",
            "Furthermore, reflexes such as the oculovestibular reflex take place at even more rapid time-scales.\n",
            "It is quite plausible that such behaviours are mediated by a purely feed-forward moving wave of spiking activity that passes from the retina through V1, into V4, IT and prefrontal cortex, until it affects motorneurons in the spinal cord that control the finger press (as in a typical laboratory experiment).\n",
            "The hypothesis that the basic processing of information is feedforward is supported most directly by the short times (approx.\n",
            "100 ms) required for a selective response to appear in IT cells.\n",
            "Conversely, conscious perception is believed to require more sustained, reverberatory neural activity, most likely via global feedback from frontal regions of neocortex back to sensory cortical areas that builds up over time until it exceeds a critical threshold.\n",
            "At this point, the sustained neural activity rapidly propagates to parietal, prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortical regions, thalamus, claustrum and related structures that support shortterm memory, multi-modality integration, planning, speech, and other processes intimately related to consciousness.\n",
            "Competition prevents more than one or a very small number of percepts to be simultaneously and actively represented.\n",
            "This is the core hypothesis of the global workspace theory of consciousness.\n",
            "In a nutshell, while rapid but transient neural activity in the thalamo-cortical system can mediate complex behaviour without conscious sensation, it is surmised that consciousness requires sustained but well-organized neural activity dependent on long- range cortico-cortical feedback.\n",
            "The objective of this series has been to try to identify the neurological structures within which mind/identity/self exists for the purpose of ensuring that biostasis does not irreparably destroy those structures.\n",

            "Neurons are highly specialized for the processing and transmission of cellular signals.\n",
            "Given the diversity of functions performed by neurons in different parts of the nervous system, there is, as expected, a wide variety in the shape, size, and electrochemical properties of neurons.\n",
            "For instance, the soma of a neuron can vary in size from 4 to 100 micrometers in diameter.\n",
            "The soma (cell body) is the central part of the neuron.\n",
            "It contains the nucleus of the cell, and therefore is where most protein synthesis occurs.\n",
            "The nucleus ranges from 3 to 18 micrometers in diameter.\n",
            "The dendrites of a neuron are cellular extensions with many branches, and metaphorically this overall shape and structure is referred to as a dendritic tree.\n",
            "This is where the much of input to the neuron occurs.\n",
            "However, information outflow (i.e. from dendrites to other neurons) can also occur (except in chemical synapse in which backflow of impulse is inhibited by the fact that axon do not possess chemoreceptors and dendrites cannot secrete neurotransmitter chemical).\n",
            "This explains one way conduction of nerve impulse.\n",
            "The axon is a finer, cable-like projection which can extend tens, hundreds, or even tens of thousands of times the diameter of the soma in length.\n",
            "The axon carries nerve signals away from the soma (and also carry some types of information back to it).\n",
            "Many neurons have only one axon, but this axon may - and usually will - undergo extensive branching, enabling communication with many target cells.\n",
            "The part of the axon where it emerges from the soma is called the ‘axon hillock’.\n",
            "In addition to being an anatomical structure, the axon hillock is also the part of the neuron that has the greatest density of voltage-dependent sodium channels.\n",
            "This makes it the most easily-excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon: in neurological terms it has the greatest hyperpolarized action potential threshold.\n",
            "While the axon and axon hillock are generally involved in information outflow, this region can also receive input from other neurons as well.\n",
            "The axon terminal is a specialized structure at the end of the axon that is used to release neurotransmitter chemicals and communicate with target neurons.\n",
            "Although the canonical view of the neuron attributes dedicated functions to its various anatomical components, dendrites and axons often act in ways contrary to their so-called main function.\n",
            "Axons and dendrites in the central nervous system are typically only about a micrometer thick, while some in the peripheral nervous system are much thicker.\n",
            "The soma is generally about 10–25 micrometers in diameter and often is not much larger than the cell nucleus it contains.\n",
            "The longest axon of a human motor neuron can be over a meter long, reaching from the base of the spine to the toes.\n",

            "The release of an excitatory neurotransmitter (e.g. glutamate) at the synapses will cause an inflow of positively charged sodium ions (Na+) making a localized depolarization of the membrane.\n",
            "The current then flows to the resting (polarized) segment of the axon.\n",
            "Inhibitory synapse causes an inflow of Cl- (chlorine) or outflow of K+ (potassium) making the synaptic membrane hyperpolarized.\n",
            "This increase prevents depolarization, causing a decrease in the possibility of an axon discharge.\n",
            "If they are both equal to their charges, then the operation will cancel itself out.\n",
            "This effect is referred to as summation.\n",
            "There are two kinds of summation: spatial and temporal.\n",
            "Spatial summation requires several excitatory synapses (firing various times) to add up, thus causing an axon discharge.\n",
            "It also occurs within inhibitory synapses, where just the opposite will occur.\n",
            "In temporal summation, it causes an increase of the frequency at the same synapses until it is large enough to cause a discharge.\n",
            "Spatial and temporal summation can occur at the same time as well.\n",
            "The neurons of the brain release inhibitory neurotransmitters far more than excitatory neurotransmitters, which helps explain why we are not aware of all memories and all sensory stimuli simultaneously.\n",

            "Different neurons are sensitive to different stimuli(although most can register pain).\n",
            "The stimulus causes sodium ion channels to open.\n",
            "The rapid change in polarity that moves along the nerve fiber is known as the “action potential.”\n",
            "In order for an action potential to occur, it must reach threshold.\n",
            "If threshold does not occur, then no action potential can occur.\n",
            "This moving change in polarity has many stages:\n",
            "The upswing is caused when positively charged sodium ions (Na+) suddenly rush through open sodium gates into a nerve cell.\n",
            "The membrane potential of the stimulated cell undergoes a localized change from -55 millivolts to 0 in a limited area.\n",
            "As additional sodium rushes in, the membrane potential actually reverses its polarity so that the outside of the membrane is negative relative to the inside.\n",
            "During this change of polarity the membrane actually develops a positive value for a moment(+30 millivolts).\n",
            "The change in voltage stimulates the opening of additional sodium channels (called a voltage-gated ion channel).\n",
            "This is an instance of a positive feedback loop.\n",
            "The downswing is caused by the closing of sodium ion channels and the opening of potassium ion channels.\n",
            "Release of positively charged potassium ions (K+) from the nerve cell when potassium gates open.\n",
            "Again, these are opened in response to the positive voltage—they are voltage gated.\n",
            "This expulsion acts to restore the localized negative membrane potential of the cell (about -65 or - 70 mV is typical for nerves).\n",
            "When the potassium ions are below resting potential (-90 mV).\n",
            "Since the cell is hyper polarized, it goes to a refractory phrase.\n",
            "Neurophysiology\n",
            "The refractory period is a short period of time after the depolarization stage.\n",
            "Shortly after the sodium gates open, they close and go into an inactive conformation.\n",
            "The sodium gates cannot be opened again until the membrane is repolarized to its normal resting potential.\n",
            "The sodium-potassium pump returns sodium ions to the outside and potassium ions to the inside.\n",
            "During the refractory phase this particular area of the nerve cell membrane cannot be depolarized.\n",
            "This refractory area explains why action potentials can only move forward from the point of stimulation.\n",
            "Increased permeability of the sodium channel occurs when there is a deficit of calcium ions.\n",
            "When there is a deficit of calcium ions (Ca+2) in the interstitial fluid, the sodium channels are activated (opened) by very little increase of the membrane potential above the normal resting level.\n",
            "The nerve fiber can therefore fire off action potentials spontaneously, resulting in tetany.\n",
            "This could be caused by the lack of hormone from parathyroid glands.\n",
            "It could also be caused by hyperventilation, which leads to a higher pH, which causes calcium to bind and become unavailable.\n",
            "This area of depolarization/repolarization/recovery moves along a nerve fiber like a very fast wave.\n",
            "In myelinated fibers, conduction is hundreds of times faster because the action potential only occurs at the nodes of Ranvier (pictured below in ‘types of neurons’) by jumping from node to node.\n",

            "There are two most important structures within the limbic system and several smaller structures that are important as well.\n",
            "They are:\n",
            "1. The Hippocampus\n",
            "The Hippocampus is found deep in the temporal lobe, shaped like a seahorse.\n",
            "It consists of two horns that curve back from the amygdala.\n",
            "It is situated in the brain so as to make the prefrontal area aware of our past experiences stored in that area.\n",
            "The prefrontal area of the brain consults this structure to use memories to modify our behaviour.\n",
            "The hippocampus is a primary contributor to memory.\n",
            "The Amygdala is a little almond shaped structure, deep inside the anteroinferior region of the temporal lobe, that connects with the hippocampus, the septi nuclei, the prefrontal area and the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus.\n",
            "These connections make it possible for the amygdala to play its significant role on the mediation and control of such activities and feelings as love, friendship, affection, and expression of mood.\n",
            "The amygdala is the center for identification of danger and is fundamental for self preservation.\n",
            "The amygdala is the nucleus responsible for fear.\n",
            "Lesions or stimulation of the medial, dorsal, and anterior nuclei of the thalamus are associated with changes in emotional reactivity.\n",
            "However, the significane of these nuclei on the regulation of emotional behaviour is not due to the thalamus itself, but to the connections of these nuclei with other limbic system structures.\n",
            "The medial dorsal nucleus makes connections with cortical zones of the prefrontal area and with the hypothalamus.\n",
            "The\n",
            "anterior nuclei connect with the mamillary bodies and through them, via fornix, with the hippocampus and the cingulated gyrus, thus taking part in what is known as the Papez’s circuit.\n",
            "The Hypothalamus is a small part of the brain located just below the thalamus on both sides of the third ventricle.\n",
            "Lesions of the hypothalamus interfere with various vegetative functions and some so called motivated behaviours like sexuality, combativeness, and hunger.\n",
            "The hypothalamus also plays a role in emotion.\n",
            "Specifically, the lateral parts seem to be involved with pleasure and rage, while the medial part is linked to aversion, displeasure, and a tendency to uncontrollable and loud laughing.\n",
            "However, in general the hypothalamus has more to do with the expression of emotions.\n",
            "When the physical symptoms of emotion appear, the threat they pose returns, via the hypothalamus, to the limbic centers and then the prefrontal nuclei, increasing anxiety.\n",
            "These small structures are important connecting pathways for the limbic system.\n",
            "The Cingulate Gyrus is located in the medial side of the brain between the cingulated sulcus and the corpus callosum.\n",
            "There is still much to be learned about this gyrus, but it is already known that its frontal part coordinates smells and sights, with pleasant memories of previous emotions.\n",
            "The region participates in the emotional reaction to pain and in the regulation of aggressive behaviour.\n",
            "Memory is defined as : The mental faculty of retaining and recalling past experiences, the act or instance of remembering recollection.\n",
            "Learning takes place when we retain and utilize past memories.\n",
            "Overall, the mechanisms of memory are not completely understood.\n",
            "Brain areas such as the hippocampus, the amygdala, the striatum, or the mammillary bodies are thought to be involved in specific types of memory.\n",
            "For instance, the hippocampus is believed to be involved in spatial learning and declarative learning (learning information such as what you’re reading now), while the amygdala is thought to be involved in emotional memory.\n",
            "Damage to certain areas in patients and animal models and subsequent memory deficits is a primary source of information.\n",
            "However, rather than implicating a specific area, it could be that damage to adjacent areas, or to a pathway traveling through the area is actually responsible for the observed deficit.\n",
            "Further, it is insufficient to describe memory, and its counterpart, learning, as solely dependent on specific brain regions.\n",
            "Learning and memory are attributed to changes in neuronal synapses, thought to be mediated by long-term potentiation and long-term depression.\n",
            "There are three basic types of memory:\n",
            "The sensory memories act as a buffer for stimuli through senses.\n",
            "A sensory memory retains an exact copy of what is seen or heard: iconic memory for visual, echoic memory for aural and haptic memory for touch.\n",
            "Information is passed from sensory memory into short term memory.\n",
            "Some believe it lasts only 300 milliseconds, it has unlimited capacity.\n",
            "Selective attention determines what information moves from sensory memory to short term memory.\n",
            "Short Term Memory acts as a scratch pad for temporary recall of the information under process.\n",
            "For instance, in order to understand this sentence you need to hold in your mind the beginning of the sentence as you read the rest.\n",
            "Short term memory decays fastly and also has a limited capacity.\n",
            "Chunking of information can lead to an increase in the short term memory capacity, this is the reason why a hyphenated phone number is easier to remember than a single long number.\n",
            "The successful formation of a chunk is known as closure.\n",
            "Interference often causes disturbance in short term memory retention.\n",
            "This accounts for the desire to complete a task held in short term memory as soon as possible.\n",
            "Within short term memory there are three basic operations:\n",
            "1. Iconic memory - the ability to hold visual images\n",
            "2. Acoustic memory - the ability to hold sounds.\n",
            "Can be held longer than iconic.\n",
            "3. Working memory - an active attentional process to keep it until it is put to use.\n",
            "Note that the goal is not really to move the information from short term memory to long term memory, but merely to put it to immediate use.\n",
            "The process of transferring information from short term to long term memory involves the encoding or consolidation of information.\n",
            "This is not a function of time, that is, the longer the memory stays in the short term the more likely it is to be placed in the long term memory.\n",
            "On organizing complex information in short term before it can be encoded into the long term memory, in this process the meaningfulness or emotional content of an item may play a greater role in its retention in the long term memory.\n",
            "The limbic system sets up local reverberating circuits such as the Papez’s Circuit.\n",
            "Long Term Memory is used for storage of information over a long time.\n",
            "Information from short to long term memory is transferred after a short period.\n",
            "Unlike short term memory, long term memory has little decay.\n",
            "Long term potential is an enhanced response at the synapse within the hippocampus.\n",
            "It is ineviable to memory storage.\n",
            "The limbic system isn’t directly involved in long term memory necessarily but it selects them from short term memory, consolidates these memories by playing them like a continuous tape, and involves the hippocampus and amygdala.\n",
            "There are two kinds of long term memory:\n",
            "Episodic memory represents our memory of events and experiences in a serial form.\n",
            "It is from this memory that we can reconstruct the actual events that took place at a given point in our lives.\n",
            "Semantic memory, on the other hand, is a structured record of facts, concepts, and skills that we have acquired.\n",
            "The information in the semantic memory is derived from our own episode memory, such as that we can learn new facts or concepts from experiences.\n",
            "There are three chief activities that are related to long term memory:\n",
            "Information for short term memory is stored in long term memory by rehearsal.\n",
            "The repeated exposure to a stimulus or the rehearsal of a piece of information transfers it into long term memory.\n",
            "Experiments also suggest that learning is most effective if it is distributed over time.\n",
            "Deletion is mainly caused by decay and interference.\n",
            "Emotional factors also affect long term memory.\n",
            "However, it is debatable whether we actually ever forget anything or whether it just sometimes becomes increasingly difficult to retrieve it.\n",
            "Information may not be recalled sometimes but may be recognized, or may be recalled only with prompting.\n",
            "This leads us to the third operation of memory, information retrieval.\n",
            "There are two sorts of information retrieval:\n",
            "In recall, the information is reproduced from memory.\n",
            "In recognition the presentation of the information provides the knowledge that the information has been seen before.\n",
            "Recognition is of lesser complexity, as the information is provided as a cue.\n",
            "However, the recall may be assisted by the provision of retrieval cues which enable the subject to quickly access the information in memory.\n",
            "Long-term potentiation (LTP) is the lasting enhancement of connections between two neurons that results from stimulating them simultaneously.\n",
            "Since neurons communicate via chemical synapses, and because memories are believed to be stored by virtue of patterns of activation of these synapses, LTP and its opposing process, long-term depression, are widely considered the major cellular mechanisms that underlie learning and memory.\n",
            "This has been proven by lab experiments.\n",
            "When one of the chemicals involved is inhibited in rats, it causes retrograde amnesia with short term memory left intact (meaning they can’t recall events from before the inhibitor was given).\n",
            "Having enhanced synaptic transmission, LTP improves the ability of two neurons, one presynaptic and the other postsynaptic, to communicate with one another across a synapse.\n",
            "The precise mechanism for this enhancement isn’t known, but it varies based on things like brain region, age and species.\n",
            "This will focus on LTP in the CA1 section of the hippocampus, because that’s what is well known.\n",
            "The end result of LTP is a well established neural circuit that can be called upon later for memory.\n",
            "LTP in the CA1 hippocampus is called NMDA receptordependent LTP. It has four main properties.\n",
            "LTP can be rapidly induced by applying one or more brief, high-frequency, stimulus to a presynaptic cell.\n",
            "Once induced, LTP at one synapse does not spread to other synapses; rather LTP is input specific.\n",
            "LTP is only propagated to those synapses according to the rules of associativity and cooperativity.\n",
            "Associativity refers to the observation that when weak stimulation of a single pathway is insufficient for the induction of LTP, simultaneous strong stimulation of another pathway will induce LTP at both pathways.\n",
            "LTP can be induced either by strong tetanic stimulation of a single pathway to a synapse, or cooperatively via the weaker stimulation of many.\n",
            "When one pathway into a synapse is stimulated weakly, it produces insufficient postsynaptic depolarization to induce LTP. In contrast, when weak stimuli are applied to many pathways that converge on a single patch of postsynaptic membrane, the individual postsynaptic depolarizations generated may collectively depolarize the postsynaptic cell enough to induce LTP cooperatively.\n",
            "Synaptic tagging, discussed later, may be a common mechanism underlying associativity and cooperativity.\n",
            "LTP is generally divided into three parts that occur sequentially: Short-term potentiation, early LTP (E-LTP) and late LTP (L-LTP).\n",
            "Short-term potentiation isn’t well understood and will not be discussed.\n",
            "E-LTP and L-LTP phases of LTP are each characterized by a series of three events: induction, maintenance and expression.\n",
            "Induction happens when a short-lived signal triggers that phase to begin.\n",
            "Maintenance corresponds to the persistent biochemical changes that occur in response to the induction of that phase.\n",
            "Expression entails the long-lasting cellular changes that result from activation of the maintenance signal.\n",
            "Each phase of LTP has a set of mediator molecules that dictate the events of that phase.\n",
            "These molecules include protein receptors, enzymes, and signaling molecules that allow progression from one phase to the next.\n",
            "Besides to mediators, there are modulator molecules that interact with mediators to fine tune the LTP. Modulators are a bit beyond the scope of this introductory book, and won’t be discussed here.\n",

            "The nervous system is a control system of the body and is a bit like a computer.\n",
            "The brain is similar to the software and is responsible for making decisions and the nerves are like the hardware or wiring that communicates those decisions with the rest of the body.\n",
            "The nervous system along with the endocrine (hormonal) system works to control all activities within the human body.\n",
            "It does this by communicating messages between the brain and the body very quickly using nerve impulses (action potentials).\n",
            "The four chief functions of the nervous system are:\n",
            "1. Control of body’s internal environment to maintain ‘homeostasis’: An example of this is the regulation of body temperature.\n",
            "As we exercise we create heat, in order to maintain a relatively constant core temperature the nervous system sends messages to the blood vessels to dilate\n",
            "(expand), increasing blood flow to the skin, and increasing sweating to help disperse the accumulating heat.\n",
            "2. Programming of spinal cord reflexes: An instance of this is the stretch reflex.\n",
            "This reflex functions to protect us from injury.\n",
            "If we were out jogging and accidentally ran into a pot-hole and rolled our ankle, the stretch reflex would instantly sense the stretch in the muscles around the ankle and send messages to those muscles telling them to contract and resist the stretch.\n",
            "This reflex serves to protect the ankle from breaking and results in a minor sprain rather than a severe break.\n",
            "3. Memory and learning: You didn’t learn to read or write overnight did you?\n",
            "A certain amount of repetition was required to learn and memorise these key functions.\n",
            "The same applies with exercise.\n",
            "New movements, especially complex ones, take time for the nervous system to learn.\n",
            "Remember this when teaching new exercises to people – a certain amount of repetition will need to occur before their nervous system gets it right!\n",
            "4. Voluntary control of movement: Every voluntary movement that a person performs is under the direct control of the nervous system as the nervous system sends the messages to the particular body parts to move.\n",
            "If the movement has been repeated numerous times (walking for most of us…) the movement will be very efficient.\n",
            "If however the movement is new and still requires some repetition then we would expect the movement to be less efficient and in some cases look awkward and ungainly (such as a person learning the squat for the first time).\n",
            "The nervous system is integral to our ability to function in everyway.\n",
            "As we know muscle creates movement by contracting and pulling on our bones.\n",
            "However it is the nervous system that is responsible for stimulating the muscles and causing them to contract.\n",
            "Without the neural impulses of the nervous system, muscle would simply not work.\n",
            "When someone experiences a severe trauma to their spinal cord, it will often result in paralysis of their body below the point of trauma.\n",
            "For example if the spinal cord is damaged above the nerves that stimulate their lower body (legs etc), then they will not be able to walk again.\n",
            "This is because the messages which are intended for the legs can no longer reach them.\n",
            "In essence it is like the power cable to your house being cut and the lights going out.\n",
            "The nervous system is not just responsible for stimulating muscle; it stimulates every tissue and organ within the body.\n",
            "It is therefore important that you understand the nervous system so that you can train clients safely and effectively.\n",
            "The nervous system and fitness go hand in hand.\n",
            "Completing an activity that you have done thousands of times like running, learning a new skill such as squatting or simply thinking about the activity you are about to do all utilise the nervous system.\n",
            "For instance when a client learns a new exercise, like the dumbbell bench press, you may find that the movement is quite awkward and difficult for them.\n",
            "This is because their nervous system is trying to learn something new. However the more they repeat and refine the same movement the more efficient and\n",
            "smooth it becomes, until it is second nature.\n",
            "When working with clients, a lot of the initial gains come from improvements in the nervous system as it learns new movement patterns and becomes more efficient at doing its job.\n",
            "It is also worth noting however, that if you give a client an exercise that is too advanced for them they may be deterred from exercising.\n",
            "This is because the experience of not being able to do the exercise, feeling vulnerable while lifting weights or being excessively sore the next day may put them off.\n",
            "Ensuring your client is challenged sufficiently and appropriately to achieve their goals is fundamental when working in fitness.\n",
            "To help you do this understanding the nervous system and your clients ability is important.\n",
            "This is because it will help you pick the correct types of exercise and intensities for clients, as well as know when to progress or regress an exercise.\n",

            "The somatic division of the nervous system contains nerves which end in the skeletal muscles.\n",
            "These nerves conduct impulses which control the skeletal muscles in response to a directive that comes from the brain.\n",

            "The spinal cord provides an ASCENDING pathway for sensory information travelling from sensory receptors in the body up to the brain and a DESCENDING pathway for motor information travelling down from the brain to the motor units.\n",
            "The spinal cord also acts like a switchboard for reflexes or movements requiring speed.\n",
            "With reflexes, motor responses (movements) are initiated at the spinal cord rather than the brain.\n",
            "This is because with reflexes speed is the absolute key – precious\n",

            "Withdrawal and jerk are the most common types of reflexes.\n",
            "An instance of a withdrawal reflex is putting your hand on a hot element and moving it away before the sensation of pain is registered.\n",
            "In this reflex sensory information is relayed to the spinal cord through a sensory neuron.\n",
            "The spinal cord then sends a command via a motor neuron back to the motor unit telling it to contract the muscle and move the hand off the element.\n",
            "An instance of the jerk reflex is the kick of the leg resulting from a tap on the patella tendon.\n",
            "This usually happens at the doctors when they are testing function.\n",
            "As shown on the adjacent diagram a stretch receptor in the muscle senses the tap on the patella and sends this information to the spinal cord via a sensory nerve.\n",

            "Prebent areas of interest in this field have a wide range, spanning anywhere from the maintenance of circadian rhythms, the progression of neurodegenerative disorders, the persistence of periodic disorders, and the effects of mitochondrial decay on metabolism.\n",
            "Advances in molecular biology techniques and the specieswide genome project have made it possible to map out an individual’s entire genome.\n",
            "Whether genetic or environmental factors are primarily responsible for an individual’s personality has long been a topic of debate.\n",
            "Thanks to the advances being made in the field of neurogenetics, researchers have begun to tackle this question by beginning to map out genes and correlate them to different personality traits.\n",
            "There is little to no evidence to suggest that the presence of a single gene indicates that an individual will express one style of behaviour over another; rather, having a specific gene could make one more predisposed to displaying this kind of behaviour.\n",
            "It is starting to become clear that most genetically influenced behaviours are due to the effects of multiple genes, besides other neurological regulating factors like neurotransmitter levels.\n",
            "Aggression, for example, has been linked to at least 16 different genes, many of which have been shown to have different influences on levels of serotonin and dopamine, neurotransmitter density, and other aspects of brain structure and chemistry.\n",
            "Similar findings have been found in studies of impulsivity and alcoholism.\n",
            "Because of to fact that many behavioural\n",
            "characteristics have been conserved across species for generations, researchers are able to use animal subjects such as mice and rats, but also fruit flies, worms, and zebrafish, to try to determine specific genes that correlate to behaviour and attempt to match these with human genes.\n",
            "While it is true that variation between species can appear to be pronounced, at their most basic they share many similar behaviour traits which are necessary for survival.\n",
            "Such traits include mating, aggression, foraging, social behaviour and sleep patterns.\n",
            "This conservation of behaviour across species has led biologists to hypothesize that these traits could possibly have similar, if not the same, genetic causes and pathways.\n",
            "Studies conducted on the genomes of a plethora of organisms have revealed that many organisms have homologous genes, meaning that some genetic material has been conserved between species.\n",
            "If these organisms shared a common evolutionary ancestor, then this might imply that aspects of behaviour can be inherited from previous generations, lending support to the genetic causes  as opposed to the environmental causes - of behaviour.\n",
            "Variations in personalities and behavioural traits seen amongst individuals\n",
            "of the same species could be explained by differing levels of expression of these genes and their corresponding proteins.\n",
            "Impulsivity is the inclination of an individual to initiate behaviour without adequate forethought.\n",
            "An individual with high impulsivity will be more likely to act in ways that are not generally beneficial or are outside the normal range of action one would expect to see.\n",
            "Through the use of such techniques as fMRI and PET scans, differences in impulsivity have been seen to be directly influenced by a right lateralized neural circuit.\n",
            "In addition, impulsivity levels have been linked to brain density levels, specifically the density of white and grey matter and levels of myelination.\n",
            "This suggests that there are specific areas of the brain that play a direct role in the regulation of behaviour.\n",
            "This indicates a possible genetic correlation since all human brains have the same general anatomical make up.\n",
            "A 2008 study found a significant correlation between gene expression and brain structure in both model organisms and humans.\n",
            "The levels of expression of dopamine and serotonin in particular have been found to be very influential on brain structure.\n",
            "DAT and DRD4 genes, both of which code for proteins that contribute to the density of the prefrontal gray matter, also have been found to be particularly significant.\n",
            "Individuals with ADHD, specifically those with a DRD 4/4 genotype, were found to have smaller prefrontal gray matter volume than those without the 4/4 genotype, indicating that their level of impulse control would be lower than normal.\n",
            "There are several other genes that can contribute to either brain density or its composition, and further studies are being conducted to determine the significance of each.\n",
            "Corresponding to impulsivity, varying levels of cognition have been linked to various different genes, several of which are related to dopamine genes expression in frontostriatal circuitry.\n",
            "These genes have been seen to play a role in higher cognitive functions such as learning and motivation, possibly by acting on the reward system in the dopamine pathway.\n",
            "It has been shown that these factors, along with many others not related to dopamine, such as CHRM2, are highly heritable.\n",
            "While several executive functions can be learned through experience and environmental factors, individuals with these specific genes, particularly those with high expression levels, were shown to possess higher cognitive function than those without them.\n",
            "One possible explanation for this is that these genes act as high motivational factor, making these individuals more likely to either develop better cognitive function naturally or participate in activities that result in higher cognitive function by means of experience.\n",
            "Much of this motivation may arise from reward based learning.\n",
            "In this type of learning, a particular outcome is more\n",
            "positive than anticipated, resulting in a higher level of dopamine being released in the brain.\n",
            "Dopamine release was for a long time thought to result in a feeling of pleasure, causing an increase in this behaviour.\n",
            "However, recent advances in our understanding of reward prediction and learning are leading researchers to view dopamine simply as a reward-error signal, rather than being responsible for inducing the feeling of pleasure.\n",
            "Over time this reward-seeking behaviour will increase synaptic plasticity, resulting in an increase in neuronal connections and faster response times.\n",
            "There is also research being conducted on how an individual’s genes can cause varying levels of aggression and aggression control.\n",
            "Throughout the animal kingdom, varying styles, types and levels of aggression can be observed leading scientists to believe that there might be a genetic contribution that has conserved this particular behavioural trait.\n",
            "For some species varying levels of aggression have indeed exhibited direct correlation to a higher level of Darwinian fitness.\n",
            "The effect serotonin (5-HT) and the varying genes, proteins and enzymes have on aggression is the focus of studies currently.\n",
            "This pathway has been linked to aggression through its influences on early brain development and morphology, as well as directly regulating an individual’s level of impulsive aggression.\n",
            "One enzyme that researchers believe plays a direct role in aggression control is the enzyme MAO, which is partially liable for the degradation of serotonin and thus aggression control.\n",
            "The genes, as well as the proteins themselves, for the 5-HT receptor, as well as the 5-HT transporter, SERT, also have a direct effect on the level of aggression seen in test subjects.\n",
            "The up regulation of a specific 5-HT receptor, 5-HT1A, and the down regulation of SERT, both contribute to lowering an individual’s level of aggression.\n",
            "While studies have been conducted on humans, such as Han Brunner’s experiment with a MAO-A deficient Dutch family, which first hinted at the possible linkage between MAO A and aggression, and was later confirmed by Isabelle Seif’s mouse experiment, much of the current research is being conducted on zebrafish to identify the underlying genetic and morphological aspects that lead to aggression as well as many other behavioural traits.\n",
            "The study of alcoholism and the neurogenetic factors that increase one’s susceptibility is a budding field of study.\n",
            "A multitude of genes associated with the condition have been found which can act as indicators for an individual’s predisposition to alcoholism.\n",
            "Improper expression of ALDH2 and ADH1B leads to polymorphism and causes these two enzymes to function improperly, making it difficult to digest alcohol.\n",
            "This kind of expression has been found to be a strong indicator of alcoholism, along with the presence of GABRA2, a gene which codes for a specific GABA receptor.\n",
            "How GABRA2 leads to alcohol dependence is still unclear, but it is thought to interact negatively with alcohol, altering the behavioural effect and resulting in dependency.\n",
            "In general, these genes code for receptor or digestive proteins, and while having these particular genes does indicate a predisposition towards alcoholism, it is not a definitive determining factor.\n",
            "Like all behavioural traits, genes alone do not determine an individual’s personality or behaviour, for the influence of the environment is just as important.\n",

            "Reconstruction of a pedigree of these 24 patients with common clinical phenotypes of MS found that “the shortest connection to a common ancestor between two individuals with MS was significantly more often through their nonaffected mother than through their nonaffected father, suggesting a maternal parent-of- origin effect” that was specific for MS, noted Dr. Hoppenbrouwers and colleagues.\n",
            "“Mothers of the 24 MS patients were also more closely related to each other than their fathers.”\n",
            "Maternal transmission of MS can be a result of genetic factors, environmental factors, or both.\n",

            "More than 1,000 genetic tests are currently in use, and more are being developed.\n",
            "Various methods can be used for genetic testing:\n",
            "• Molecular genetic tests (or gene tests) study single genes or short lengths of DNA to identify variations or mutations that lead to a genetic disorder.\n",
            "• Chromosomal genetic tests analyze whole chromosomes or long lengths of DNA to see if there are large genetic changes, such as an extra copy of a chromosome, that cause a genetic condition.\n",
            "• Biochemical genetic tests study the amount or activity level of proteins; abnormalities in either can indicate changes to the DNA that result in a genetic disorder.\n",
            "Genetic testing is voluntary.\n",
            "Because testing has benefits as well as limitations and risks, the decision about whether to be tested is a personal and complex one.\n",
            "A geneticist or genetic counselor can help by providing information about the pros and cons of the test and discussing the social and emotional aspects of testing.\n",
            "Genetic testing looks for specific inherited changes (mutations) in a person’s chromosomes, genes, or proteins.\n",
            "Genetic mutations can have harmful, beneficial, neutral (no effect), or uncertain effects on health.\n",
            "Mutations that are harmful may increase a person’s chance, or risk, of developing a disease such as cancer.\n",
            "Overall, inherited mutations are thought to play a role in about 5 to 10 percent of all cancers.\n",
            "Cancer can sometimes appear to “run in families” even if it is not caused by an inherited mutation.\n",
            "For instance, a shared environment or lifestyle, such as tobacco use, can cause similar cancers to develop among family members.\n",
            "However, certain patterns—such as the types of cancer that develop, other non-cancer conditions that are seen, and the ages at which cancer typically develops—may suggest the presence of a hereditary cancer syndrome.\n",
            "The genetic mutations that cause many of the known hereditary cancer syndromes have been identified, and genetic testing can confirm whether a condition is, indeed, the result of an inherited syndrome.\n",
            "Genetic testing is also done to determine whether family members without obvious illness have inherited the same mutation as a family member who is known to carry a cancer-associated mutation.\n",
            "Inherited genetic mutations can increase a person’s risk of developing cancer through a variety of mechanisms, depending on the function of the gene.\n",
            "Mutations in genes that control cell growth and the repair of damaged DNA are likely to be related\n",

            "No. Even if a cancer-predisposing mutation is present in a family, it does not essentially mean that everyone who inherits the mutation will develop cancer.\n",
            "Several factors influence the outcome in a given person with the mutation.\n",
            "One factor is the pattern of inheritance of the cancer syndrome.\n",
            "To understand how hereditary cancer syndromes may be inherited, it is helpful to keep in mind that every person has two copies of most genes, with one copy inherited from each parent.\n",
            "Most mutations involved in hereditary cancer syndromes are inherited in one of two main patterns: autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive.\n",
            "With autosomal dominant inheritance, a single altered copy of the gene is enough to increase a person’s chances of developing cancer.\n",
            "In this case, the parent from whom the mutation was inherited may also show the effects of the gene mutation.\n",
            "The parent may also be referred to as a carrier.\n",
            "With autosomal recessive inheritance, a person has an increased risk of cancer only if he or she inherits a mutant (altered) copy of the gene from each parent.\n",
            "The parents, who each carry one copy of the altered gene along with a normal (unaltered) copy, do not usually have an increased risk of cancer themselves.\n",
            "However, because they can pass the altered gene to their children, they are called carriers.\n",
            "A third form of inheritance of cancer-predisposing mutations is X-linked recessive inheritance.\n",
            "Males have a single Xchromosome, which they inherit from their mothers, and females have two X chromosomes (one from each parent).\n",
            "A female with a recessive cancer-predisposing mutation on one of her X chromosomes and a normal copy of the gene on her other X chromosome is a carrier but will not have an increased risk of cancer.\n",
            "Her sons, however, will have only the altered copy of the gene and will therefore have an increased risk of cancer.\n",
            "Even when people have one copy of a dominant cancer-predisposing mutation, two copies of a recessive mutation, or, for males, one copy of an X-linked recessive mutation, they may not develop cancer.\n",
            "Some mutations are “incompletely penetrant,” which means that only some people will show the effects of these mutations.\n",
            "Mutations can also “vary in their expressivity,” which means that the severity of the symptoms may vary from person to person.\n",
            "Genetic tests available for cancer risk More than 50 hereditary cancer syndromes have been described.\n",

            "These results are described below.\n",
            "A “positive test result” means that the laboratory found a specific genetic alteration (or mutation) that is associated with ahereditary cancer syndrome.\n",

            "• Indicate an increased risk of developing certain cancer(s) in the future\n",

            "• Being checked at a younger age or more often for signs of cancer\n",
            "• Reducing their cancer risk by taking medications or having surgery to remove “at-risk” tissue (These approaches to risk reduction are options for only a few inherited cancer syndromes.)\n",

            "The results of pre-implantation testing (performed on embryos created by in vitro fertilization) can guide a doctor in deciding which embryo (or embryos) to implant in a woman’s uterus.\n",
            "Finally, in patients who have already been diagnosed with cancer, a positive result for a mutation associated with certain hereditary cancer syndromes can influence how the cancer is treated.\n",
            "For instance, some hereditary cancer disorders interfere with the body’s ability to repair damage that occurs to cellular DNA.\n",
            "If someone with one of these conditions receives a standard dose of radiation or chemotherapy to treat their cancer, they may experience severe, potentially life-threatening treatment side effects.\n",
            "Knowing about the genetic disorder before treatment begins allows doctors to modify the treatment and reduce the severity of the side effects.\n",
            "A “negative test result” means that the laboratory did not find the specific alteration that the test was designed to detect.\n",
            "This result is most useful when working with a family in which the specific, disease-causing genetic alteration is already known to be present.\n",
            "In such a case, a negative result can show that the tested family member has not inherited the mutation that is present in their family and that this person therefore does not have the inherited cancer syndrome tested for, does not have an increased genetic risk of developing cancer, or is not a carrier of a mutation that increases cancer risk.\n",
            "Such a test result is called a “true negative.”\n",
            "A true negative result does not mean that there is no cancer risk, but rather that the risk is perhaps the same as the cancer risk in the general population.\n",
            "When a person has a strong family history of cancer but the family has not been found to have a known mutation associated with a hereditary cancer syndrome, a negative test result is classified as an “uninformative negative” (that is, does not provide useful information).\n",
            "It is not possible to tell whether someone has a harmful gene mutation that was not detected by the particular test used (a “false negative”) or whether the person truly has no cancer-predisposing genetic alterations in that gene.\n",
            "It is also possible for a person to have a mutation in a gene other than the gene that was tested.\n",
            "If genetic testing shows a change that has not been previously related to cancer in other people, the person’s test result may report “variant of unknown significance,” or VUS.\n",
            "This result may be interpreted as “ambiguous” (uncertain), which is to say that the information does not help in making health care decisions.\n",
            "If the test reveals a genetic change that is common in the general population among people without cancer, the change is called a polymorphism.\n",
            "Everyone has commonly occurring genetic variations (polymorphisms) that are not associated with any increased risk of disease.\n",
            "Who help people to understand their test results?\n",
            "A genetic counselor, doctor, or other health care professional trained in genetics can help an individual or family understand their test results.\n",
            "Such counseling may include discussing recommendations for preventive care and screening with the patient, referring the patient to support groups and other information resources, and providing emotional support to the person receiving the results.\n",
            "In some cases, a genetic counselor or doctor may recommend that other family members consider being tested for specific gene changes that indicate an increased risk of cancer.\n",
            "The decision to test other family members is complicated.\n",
            "It requires a careful evaluation of family history and other factors as well as advice from a genetic counselor or other professional trained in genetics.\n",
            "In general, physicians rely on the family member who has been tested to share the genetic information with their relatives so that family members will know that a genetic condition has been identified in their family.\n",
            "Then, each family member will need to make their own decision regarding whether or not to be tested themselves.\n",

            "Moreover, linking an expanded polyQ repeat to the cytoplasmic protein Hprt results in the formation of nuclear polyQ inclusions in the brains of transgenic mice [7].\n",
            "Thus, inspile of different subcellular localizations of the normal polyQ proteins, mutant proteins with their expanded polyQ repeats commonly form nuclear inclusions or accumulate in the nucleus; such a common feature could be related towith the selective neuropathology of polyQ diseases.\n",
            "PolyQ inclusions in the nucleus are colocalized with ubiquitin, proteasome components, and heat shock proteins [3, 8–10].\n",
            "These findings suggest that polyQ protein deposits are targeted by cellular clearing systems.\n",
            "PolyQ inclusions are likely to be compact structures consisting primarily of the polyQ protein itself, since expanded polyQ repeats can cause self-association of polyQ peptides, leading to various forms of the proteins with different conformations.\n",
            "Examination of the brains of HD patients indicates that only truncated N-terminal htt fragments with an expanded polyQ tract are capable of forming nuclear inclusions, as these nuclear inclusions can only be labeled by antibodies against the N-terminal, but not the internal or C-terminal, region of htt.\n",

            "The fact that small htt fragments form nuclear inclusions suggests that a shorter peptide with a larger polyQ tract tends to\n",
            "misfold and aggregate more rapidly.\n",
            "In other polyQ diseases, it is also evident that shorter polyQ proteins are prone to misfolding and aggregation.\n",

            "Similarly, brain samples from SCA3 patients as well as mice transgenic for full-length ataxin-3 with 71Q showed the production of a C-terminal truncated fragment with the expanded polyQ domain.\n",
            "Furthermore, the production of small polyQ protein fragments is found to be required for aggregation, indicating that proteolytic processing of polyQ proteins is critical for the generation of toxic and misfolded polyQ proteins.\n",
            "Although the role of nuclear inclusions remains controversial, the formation of these nuclear inclusions clearly results from the nuclear accumulation of misfolded and toxic forms of mutant polyQ proteins.\n",

            "The presence of an expanded polyQ tract reduces the association of N-terminal htt with the translocated promoter region protein (Tpr).\n",
            "Tpr is a nuclear pore protein that localizes to the nucleoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex and exports molecules from the nucleus.\n",
            "Expanded htt exhibits decreased interaction with Tpr compared with wild-type htt and thereby shows reduced nuclear export and increased nuclear accumulation.\n",
            "Thus their study suggests that polyQ-expanded htt is prone to misfolding in the nucleus, which subsequently reduces its ability to exit the nucleus.\n",
            "This study also raises the interesting issue of whether the nuclear environment itself favors the misfolding of polyQ proteins.\n",
            "Nuclear Accumulation of polyQ proteins: Its Regulation\n",

            "Because autophagy is not seen in the nucleus, it is the nuclear UPS that plays a major role in clearing mutant polyQ proteins in the nucleus.\n",
            "In vitro experiments using cultured cells have shown that overexpressed polyQ proteins can impair the function of the UPS; however, the real question is whether this impairment occurs in the brains of mouse models expressing transgenic mutant polyQ proteins.\n",
            "Various groups using different mouse models of polyQ diseases have found no decrease in UPS activity in the brain tissues of mutant mice.\n",
            "Hence the accumulation of mutant polyQ proteins in the nucleus is likely due to an intrinsic difference in the neuronal nuclear UPS activity.\n",
            "One important issue in this regard is whether the nuclear UPS has a lower activity than the cytoplasmic UPS, such that the nuclear UPS cannot efficiently degrade polyQ proteins, leading to the preferential accumulation of mutant polyQ proteins in the nucleus.\n",
            "Using fractionation and biochemical assays of the UPS activity, Zhou et al demonstrated that nuclear UPS activity is indeed lower than in the cytoplasm.\n",
            "The difference between nuclear and cytoplasmic UPS activities was also demonstrated by targeting a fluorescent UPS reporter to the cytoplasm and nucleus, which again shows that UPS activity is lower in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm.\n",
            "Another relevant question is why mutant polyQ proteins accumulate and form inclusions in the nucleus in an age-dependent manner.\n",
            "Aging is reported to increase cellular oxidative stress, which can damage the UPS and may cause an age-dependent decline in UPS activity.\n",
            "Biochemical and fluorescent UPS reporter assays have in fact revealed an age-dependent decline in mouse brain UPS activity.\n",
            "Besides, this decline is correlated with the observed age-dependent increase in nuclear htt accumulation and\n",
            "aggregation.\n",
            "Further buttressing this correlation, increased nuclear accumulation of transfected mutant htt was found in cultured cells that were treated with proteasome inhibitors.\n",
            "Thus, an agedependent decrease in the clearance of misfolded polyQ proteins explains the late onset of nuclear polyQ protein accumulation and the associated neurological phenotypes.\n",
            "Heat shock proteins are molecular chaperones that recognize and refold misfolded proteins, such as polyQ protein fragments, and the expression of endogenous chaperones, such as Hsp70, is decreased in mouse models of polyQ diseases.\n",
            "Conversely, overexpression of heat shock proteins decreases the half-life of mutant polyQ proteins expressed in cell culture.\n",
            "Although we have yet to establish whether Hsp activity is reduced in the nucleus by aging or mutant polyQ proteins, it is likely that enhancing nuclear Hsp activity or increasing the clearance of nuclear mutant polyQ proteins via the UPS should decrease the nuclear accumulation of polyQ proteins and ameliorate polyQmediated neuropathology.\n",
            "Muscular atrophy and weakness are among the most common indications of muscular disease.\n",

            "Cramps may occur with disease of the motor or sensory neurons, with certain biochemical disorders (e.g., hypocalcemia, a condition in which the blood level of calcium is abnormally low), when the muscle tissues are affected by some form of poisoning, with disease of the blood vessels, and with exercise, particularly when cold.\n",
            "Muscle enlargement (muscular hypertrophy) occurs naturally in athletes.\n",
            "Hypertrophy not associated with exercise occurs in an unusual form of muscular dystrophy known asmyotonia congenita, which combines increased muscle size with strength and stiffness.Pseudohypertrophy, muscular enlargement through deposition of fat rather than muscle fibre, occurs in other forms of muscular dystrophy, particularly the Duchenne type.\n",
            "Tetany is the occurrence of intermittent spasms, or involuntary contractions, of muscles, particularly in the arms and legs and in the larynx, or voice box; it results from low levels ofcalcium in the blood and from alkalosis, an increased alkalinity of the blood and tissues.\n",
            "Tetanus, also called lockjaw, is a state of continued muscle spasm, particularly of the jaw muscles, caused by toxins produced by the bacillus Clostridium tetani.\n",
            "The twitching of muscle fibres controlled by a single motor nerve cell, called fasciculation, may occur in a healthy person, but it generally indicates that the muscular atrophy is due to disease of motor nerve cells in the spinal cord.\n",

            "Glycogen is a storage form of carbohydrate, and its breakdown is a source of energy.\n",
            "Muscle weakness is found in a rare group of hereditary diseases, the glycogen-storage diseases, in which various enzyme defects prevent the release of energy by the normal breakdown of glycogen in muscles.\n",
            "As a result, abnormal amounts of glycogen are stored in the muscles and other organs.\n",
            "The best-known glycogen-storage disease affecting muscles is McArdle disease, in which the muscles are unable to degrade glycogen to lactic acid on exertion due to absence of the enzyme phosphorylase.\n",
            "Abnormal accumulations of glycogen are distributed within muscle cells.\n",
            "Symptoms of the condition include pain, stiffness, and weakness in the muscles on exertion.\n",
            "McArdle disease generally starts in childhood.\n",

            "With acid maltase deficiency, both heart and voluntary muscles are affected, and death usually occurs within a year of birth.\n",
            "Weakness is a failure of the muscle to develop an expected force.\n",
            "Weakness may affect all muscles or only a few, and the pattern of muscle weakness is an indication of the type of muscle disease.\n",
            "Often associated with muscle weakness is the wasting of affected muscle groups.\n",
            "A muscle may not be fully activated in weakness because of a less than maximal voluntary effort; a disease of the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves that interferes with proper electrical stimulation of the muscle fibres; or a defect in the muscle itself.\n",
            "Only when all causes have been considered can weakness be attributed to failure of the contractile machinery (i.e., the anatomy) of the muscle cell.\n",
            "The effect of weakness in a particular muscle group depends on the normal functional role of the muscle and the degree to which force fails to develop.\n",
            "A weakness in muscles that are near the ends of the limbs usually results in a tendency to drop things if the upper limb is affected or in “foot drop” if the lower limbs are affected.\n",
            "The overall disability is not as great as weakness of more proximal (closer to the body) muscles controlling the pelvic or shoulder girdles, which hold large components of the total body mass against the force of gravity.\n",
            "Weakness of the proximal muscles that control the shoulder blade (scapula), for instance, results in “winging” (i.e., when the sharp inner border protrudes backward) as the arms are held outstretched.\n",

            "Muscle disease may be detected by assessing whether the muscle groups can withhold or overcome the efforts of the physician to pull or push or by observing the individual carrying out isolated voluntary movements against gravity or more complex and integrated activities, such as walking.\n",
            "The weakness of individual muscles or groups of muscles can be quantified by using a myometer, which measures force based on a hydraulic or electronic principle.\n",
            "Recordings of contraction force over a period of time are valuable in determining whether the weakness is improving or worsening.\n",
            "The assessment of muscle weakness (and wasting) is directed toward discovering evidence of muscle inflammation or damage.\n",
            "These changes are discerned by blood tests or by measuring alterations of the electrical properties of contracting muscles.\n",

            "Muscle biopsies can be taken with a needle or during a surgical procedure.\n",
            "Muscle contraction results from a chain of events that begins with a nerve impulse traveling in the upper motor neuron from the cerebral cortex in the brain to the spinal cord.\n",
            "The nerve impulse then travels in the lower motor neuron from the spinal cord to the neuromuscular junction, where the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is released.\n",
            "Acetylcholine diffuses across the neuromuscular junction, stimulating acetylcholine receptors to depolarize the muscle membrane.\n",
            "The result is the contraction of the muscle fibre.\n",
            "Contraction depends on the integrity of each of these parts; disease or disorder in any part causes muscle weakness.\n",

            "Diseases of the motor neurons lying in the spinal cord are called motor neuron diseases.\n",
            "The most common is motor neuron disease itself, also calledamyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Lou Gehrig disease.\n",
            "Affected individuals are generally between 50 and 70 years of age and have upper and lower motor neuron weakness.\n",
            "Paralysis progresses rapidly, and death often results within three years.\n",

            "No cause is yet known for any of these diseases, and no cure is available.\n",
            "Diseases of the peripheral nerves (peripheral neuropathies, or polyneuropathies) can produce symptoms similar to the motor neuron diseases.\n",
            "Sensory disturbance due to involvement of the nerve fibres carrying sensory impulses is usually also involved.\n",
            "Symptoms usually begin in the hands and feet and progress toward the body.\n",
            "Peripheral neuropathies can cause degeneration of the axons, the core of the nerve fibres.\n",
            "The axons can regenerate but only at a rate of one to two millimetres per day.\n",
            "Thus, after injury to a nerve at the elbow, the hand will not recover for six to nine months.\n",
            "Toxins and damage to blood vessels tend to cause axonal types of neuropathy.\n",
            "Peripheral neuropathy also can be caused by degeneration of the myelin sheaths, the insulation around the axons.\n",
            "These are termed demyelinating neuropathies.\n",
            "Symptoms are similar to neuropathies with axonal degeneration, but since the axons remain intact, the muscles rarely atrophy.\n",
            "Recovery from demyelinating neuropathies can be rapid.Diphtheria and autoimmune diseases such as Guillain-Barré syndrome cause demyelinating neuropathies.\n",
            "Other causes of peripheral neuropathy include diabetes mellitus, nerve trauma, inherited factors, and chronic renal failure.\n",
            "Diseases of the neuromuscular junction typically involve the generation of an end-plate potential that is too low to propagate an action potential in the muscle fibre.\n",
            "These diseases are associated with weakness and fatigability with exercise.\n",
            "Diseases of neuromuscular transmission may be acquired or inherited and may be the result of autoimmune disorders, such as myasthenia gravis; congenital disorders; toxins such as those present in botulism; and some drug-induced disorders.\n",
            "It seems that the maintenance of muscle mass and function depends on its use.\n",
            "For instance, weight lifters and sprinters have muscle fibres with a large capacity for glycolysis (and thus ATP production) and sudden force generation.\n",
            "Striated muscles can regenerate after damage and can adapt to the loads they carry.\n",
            "Thus, in a muscle biopsy from an individual with any of the muscular dystrophies, there is likely to be a mixture of the cellular changes associated with damage and those associated with regeneration and growth (hypertrophy).\n",
            "Muscular activities in which the muscle resists an extending force (eccentric contractions) cause more damage to the muscle cells than contraction of the muscle at constant length (isometric contraction) or where shortening occurs (concentric contractions).\n",
            "The greater damage with eccentric contraction occurs despite the fact that the metabolic\n",
            "rate may be one-sixth of that of an equivalent concentric or isometric contraction.\n",
            "Muscles that are immobilized, as by a plaster cast following fracture of a long bone, tend to waste rapidly through shrinkage of the muscle fibres.\n",
            "A consistent finding is that the oxidative capacity of the muscle is reduced.\n",
            "These changes are reversible with muscle-strengthening exercises.\n",

            "There is a paradoxical increase in the size of the calf muscles, giving rise to the termpseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy (because the increase in size is the result of replacement with fat and fibrous tissue rather than growth of fibres, as in true hypertrophy).Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked condition; a defect of a gene on the X chromosome is responsible for the disease.\n",
            "Females do not manifest the disease but have a 50 percent probability of transmitting the gene to their sons and their daughters (who themselves become carriers).\n",
            "Muscle degeneration is due to the lack of a protein calleddystrophin, which causes a disruption of the membrane covering the muscle fibre; the results are the entry of excess amounts of calcium ions into the cell and cell degeneration.\n",
            "Treatment with glucocorticoid medications, specifically prednisone, may delay progression of the disease.\n",
            "Becker muscular dystrophy is similar to the Duchenne type except that it appears later in life and progresses more slowly.\n",
            "It is because of different damage to the same gene on the X chromosome that causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy; some functional dystrophin is produced.\n",
            "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy starts in the face, the muscles around the shoulder blades, and the upper arms.\n",
            "It progresses more slowly than Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and most individuals with this form of muscular dystrophy have a normal life span.\n",
            "The leg weakness frequently causes “foot drop” and a waddling gait.\n",
            "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion; thus, the affected individual will receive the gene from one parent and will have a 50 percent chance of passing the disease to his children.\n",
            "Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is similar to facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, but the face is not involved.\n",
            "Where inheritance is observed, it is generally autosomal recessive; i.e., both parents must donate the affected gene for expression of the disease.\n",

            "Death may occur suddenly when the central temperature reaches above 43 °C (110 °F).\n",
            "There is a high death rate in such attacks; should the patient recover, there will be recurrences with future exposure to these drugs.\n",
            "The condition tends to run in families, and it may be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.\n",
            "The cause is not completely known but apparently relates to an abnormality in the chemistry of calcium in the muscle fibre.\n",
            "Excess calcium is released into the sarcoplasm during exposure to the anesthetic agents, stimulating the mitochondria to burn glycogen and thereby produce heat.\n",
            "The excess calcium also causes the muscle fibres to contract and become rigid.\n",
            "Medications that prevent calcium release in the muscle appear to prevent the attack and are given at the first sign of attack.\n",

            "Theacylcarnitine that is formed crosses the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes and then is split in the presence of another form of the enzyme acyltransferase to give carnitine and the acyl molecule, which is then oxidized.\n",
            "A deficiency of carnitine results in the storage of fats in the cytoplasm.\n",
            "Deficiency of acylcarnitine transferase results in muscle damage on severe exertion.\n",
            "Early recognition is important because the conditions are potentially treatable.\n",
            "Myotonia is a difficulty in relaxing a muscle after contraction; it may manifest as difficulty in relaxing the hand after a handshake.\n",
            "Though slow relaxation may be due to delayed disengagement of the thick and thin filaments of myosin and actin, most cases of myotoniaare due to continuing electrical activity of the sarcolemma (the membrane of striated muscle fibres).\n",
            "In this most common type of myotonia, a single nerve action potential causes multiple firing of the sarcolemma, thereby continuing muscular contraction.\n",
            "The cause of this problem lies in abnormal ion channels or ion pumps in the sarcolemma, although the exact cause is not known.\n",
            "In many forms of myotonia, cold exacerbates the condition.\n",
            "Weakness is another symptom of the myotonic syndromes; myotonia tends to be more pronounced after inactivity, with a rapid “warm up” on commencing exercise.\n",
            "Myotonic dystrophy is the most common of the myotonic disorders.\n",
            "It is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting various systems of the body in addition to muscle.\n",
            "Symptoms include premature balding, cataract formation, mental impairment, gonadal atrophy, endocrine deficiencies, gastrointestinal tract dysfunction, and muscle fibre degeneration.\n",
            "While the disease has manifested itself by the age of 25 years in most cases, some affected individuals may escape developing significant symptoms throughout their lives.\n",
            "Myotonia congenita, also known as Thomsen disease, is an autosomal dominant disorder, but it is not associated with any dystrophic features.\n",
            "The onset is at birth, generally with severe difficulty in relaxing the muscle after a forced contraction, such as a sneeze.\n",
            "Myotonic goats (fainting goats), which are affected by hereditary myotonia congenita, experience severe muscle stiffening when startled.\n",
            "Insight into the molecular mechanisms\n",
            "underlying this reaction may help shed light on the equivalent disorder in humans.\n",
            "Myotonia can occur in a number of other conditions, including the periodic paralyses.\n",
            "Drugs that suppress the extent of the myotonia, such as quinine, procainamide, and phenytoin, have had variable success on the symptom of weakness.\n",
            "No cure of these diseases is yet available.\n",
            "Individuals with periodic paralysis suffer from recurrent attacks of muscle paralysis that may last from half an hour to 24 hours.\n",
            "Attacks particularly affect the legs and to a lesser extent the arms and the trunk muscles.\n",
            "During an attack the muscles may be slightly swollen and tender.\n",
            "Attacks frequently occur with rest after vigorous exercise.\n",
            "There are two types of periodic paralysis.\n",
            "In hypokalemic periodic paralysis, the level ofpotassium in the blood falls during the attack, which also can be precipitated by anything that tends to lower the potassium level.\n",
            "Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, on the other hand, is associated with an increase in the potassium level.\n",
            "An attack may be caused by oral therapy with potassium.\n",
            "Both periodic paralyses are autosomal dominant disorders.\n",
            "Though neither is likely to lead to fatal muscle weakness, the temporary incapacity may be severe.\n",
            "In the attack the muscle fibres lose their electrical potential (they become depolarized) and thereby become incapable of excitation.\n",
            "The disease appears to be due to changes in the movements of ions through membranes of the skeletal muscle.\n",
            "Potassium appears to be one of the ions responsible for the condition.\n",
            "Abnormal ion channels or ion pumps in the membrane may be the cause.\n",
            "Treatment with medications appropriately altering the potassium level, such as acetazolamide, may be effective.\n",
            "Fatigue is a failure of the muscle to sustain force in a prolonged contraction or to reattain force in repeated contractions.\n",
            "The mechanisms underlying fatigue share various features with those underlying weakness: electrical excitation of the muscle cell; electromechanical coupling; and the major processes supplying energy for contraction, work, and heat production.\n",
            "The action potential that is conducted along the length of the muscle cell originates in a depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction caused by the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminal.\n",
            "The synapse is thus potentially a key control point in the chain of command for muscular contraction.\n",
            "Complete failure of neuromuscular transmission occurs from poisoning with curare or botulinum toxin and results in complete paralysis.\n",
            "Incomplete or variable neuromuscular transmission is a feature of myasthenia gravis, the diagnosis of which can be confirmed by finding evidence of fatigue in response to electrical stimulation of the nerve supplying the muscle.\n",
            "This behaviour is a consequence of the immunologic damage to the postsynaptic membrane of the synapse by antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor.\n",
            "Electrical stimulation of a muscle via its nerve is a means by which some of the mechanisms underlying muscle fatigue can be analyzed by stimulating the nerve at a range of frequencies and measuring the force of the contractions produced.\n",
            "Failure of force at high stimulation frequencies is seen with myasthenia gravis.\n",
            "In conditions in which normal muscle is cooled or lacks blood supply, there is also a high frequency of fatigue.\n",
            "There is a relationship between the development of fatigue and the depletion of energy stores in exercising muscle.\n",
            "In prolonged exercise, such as marathon running, fatigue is associated with glycogen depletion due to oxidative glycolysis.\n",
            "Intense exercise that lasts only a few minutes is associated with the accumulation of lactate and an intracellular acidosis due to anaerobic (nonoxidative) glycolysis.\n",
            "In both types of exercise there is a reduction of phosphocreatine, although no appreciable depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).\n",
            "Contrary in individuals with myopathies, more striking changes are seen with only low total\n",
            "work or power output.\n",
            "Fatigue in individuals with McArdle disease, in whom glycogenolysis is absent, is not associated with the usual acidosis.\n",
            "Pronouncedacidosis is found in individuals with defective mitochondrial metabolism, in whom there may be a slow resynthesis of phosphocreatine after exercise.\n",
            "Neuropathology has a major role in surveillance of, and research on, prion diseases.\n",
            "For surveillance, it contributes diagnostic confirmation as well as potential identification of new disease (sub)types.\n",

            "Histopathological features of human Prion diseases have been extensively described (e.g. Budka) and will not be fully elaborated here.\n",
            "The classical triad of spongiform change, neuronal loss, and gliosis (astro- and microglia) is the neuropathological hallmark of prion diseases.\n",
            "Since neuronal loss and gliosis accompany many other conditions of the CNS, it is the spongiform change that is mostly specific to prion diseases.\n",
            "This spongiform change may be mild, moderate or severe [Plate X(B)] and is characterised by diffuse or focally clustered, small, round or oval vacuoles in the neuropil of the deep cortical layers, cerebellar cortex or subcortical grey matter, which might become confluent.\n",
            "Ultrastructurally, the spongiform changes correspond to enlarged cell processes (mainly neurites) containing curled membrane fragments and amorphous material.\n",
            "Spongiform change should not be confused with non-specific spongiosis.\n",
            "This includes status spongiosus (‘spongiform state’), comprising irregular cavities in gliotic neuropil following extensive neuronal loss (including also lesions of ‘burnt-out’ CJD), ‘spongy’ changes in brain oedema and metabolic encephalopathies, and artefacts such as superficial cortical, perineuronal, or perivascular vacuolation.\n",
            "Focal changes indistinguishable from spongiform change may occur in some cases of Alzheimer’s and diffuse Lewy body diseases.\n",
            "In contrast to prion diseases of animals, the presence of vacuoles in nerve cell bodies is uncommon in CJD.\n",
            "Ballooning of neurons observed in some instances is related to accumulation of neurofilament proteins.\n",
            "Spongiform changes and astocytosis may also involve the white matter,.\n",
            "Extensive white matter degeneration distinguishes the ‘panencephalopathic’ form of CJD, which is particularly frequent in Japan.\n",
            "Presence and distribution of spongiform change vary greatly between cases and disease subtypes.\n",
            "An almost constant location is the head of the caudate nucleus.\n",
            "By contrast, spongiform changes are rarely present in the brainstem and spinal cord, although PrP accumulation can be demonstrated at these sites.\n",
            "Generally, extensive sampling from various brain areas (including frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes, basal ganglia, and cerebellum) is mandatory in every suspected case.\n",
            "However, one block of tissue with typical histological changes and/or\n",
            "unambiguous PrPimmunoreactivity is sufficient for a definite diagnosis.\n",
            "Brain biopsy has been found to be diagnostic in 95% of CJD cases in which the disease has been confirmed at autopsy or by experimental transmission.\n",
            "However, this procedure should be restricted to rare instances where a treatable alternative diagnosis is suggested by clinical or laboratory findings.\n",
            "In sporadic CJD, the regional distribution of spongiform change in distinct patterns was shown to depend upon PrP fragment sizes and glycotypes, and codon 129 genotype in the PrP gene, PRNP,.\n",
            "However, some prion diseases have equivocal, little, or no spongiform change, such as fatal familial insomnia (FFI) that is specifically characterised by prominent thalamic atrophy with profound astrogliosis.\n",

            "CJD brains may also show age-related Alzheimer-type amyloid deposits immunoreactive for the ²/A4-peptide, with or without PrPSc co-localisation.\n",
            "Neuro-axonal dystrophy may be widespread in some CJD brains.\n",
            "The function of the normal cellular protein (PrPC), the molecular prerequisite for the manifestation of any prion disease, has not been clarified.\n",
            "However, immunohistochemistry and other methods found it predominantly expressed in neural tissue, including neurons and glial cells; other organs (e.g. uterus, placenta, thymus, heart, lung, muscle, gastrointestinal tract) also contain considerable amounts.\n",
            "Up-regulation of PrPC seems to be important in inflammatory conditions of muscle, skin and liver, as well as in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer and prion diseases.\n",
            "The conformationally abnormal, disease-associated isoform (PrPres, derived from proteinase-resistant, or PrPSc, the latter term derived from scrapie) accumulates in the CNS in the whole group of prion diseases and has become the most important diagnostic marker.\n",
            "Routine detection of PrPSc for diagnostic purposes uses methods such as immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting or ELISA assays performed on diseased tissue samples from patients obtained at autopsy, or from slaughtered animals as is done with current EU- wide testing of cattle for BSE and sheep for scrapie.\n",
            "Immunohistochemistry for PrPSc has emerged as an indispensable adjunct to the neuropathological confirmation of prion diseases, especially in cases with equivocal histopathological changes,.\n",
            "It is suitable on routinely formol-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues, although the technique may prove capricious, and pitfalls require to be considered.\n",
            "It is noteworthy that, as for the spongiform change, PrP deposition may be focal and, in rare instances, the detection of PrP immunoreactivity may require staining of several blocks.\n",
            "Unfortunately, routine immunohistochemistry for PrPSc might yield a negative result in exceptional cases, particularly in\n",
            "More recently developed techniques such as the paraffinembedded tissue blot or the use of Carnoy’s fixative are promising alternatives to increase sensitivity for the detection of PrPSc in tissues.\n",
            "However, in our European neuropathological study of human prion diseases that now encompasses tissues from almost 1000 patients, we have seen only 2 FFI brains negative with immunohistochemistry for PrP among tissue specimens fulfilling criteria for a human prion disease.\n",
            "Given the long incubation periods that make experimental transmission impractical, immunohistochemistry for PrP has also been used as a surrogate marker for infectivity in peripheral tissues that are significant for considerations of infectivity risks, such as the lymphoid system or the peripheral nervous system Moreover, PrP is also an important marker for development, spread and distribution of pathology.\n",
            "However, the amount and distribution of PrP deposits do not always correlate with type and\n",
            "severity of local tissue damage.\n",
            "In a sequential experimental study on the time course and intensity of tissue lesioning and immunohistochemistry for PrP in mice inoculated with a human CJD agent, PrP accumulation does not precede, but follows spongiform change in some brain regions.\n",
            "Local PrPSc deposition requires the local presence of neuronal, but not glial, elements: in pre-existing brain lesions such as infarctions in which neuronal elements had been focally destroyed and replaced by a gliotic scar, PrP deposition is absent [Plate X(D)].\n",
            "PrPSc and infectivity are not uniformly distributed in an individual or animal affected with a prion disease.\n",
            "Two distinct groups can be distinguished: in the first, PrPSc and infectivity have been detected in a distribution mainly limited to the central nervous system (brain, spinal cord, parts of the eye, trigeminal and spinal ganglia).\n",
            "This pattern is typical of sporadic and iatrogenic CJD, genetic human prion diseases and BSE of cattle.\n",
            "In the second, PrPSc and infectivity involve also peripheral tissues, in particular the lymphoid system, and this distribution is characteristic of vCJD, natural and experimental scrapie, experimental BSE in sheep, and CWD.\n",
            "In all prion diseases, however, most PrPSc and infectivity reside in the CNS during clinical disease or late in the incubation period.\n",
            "This differential distribution of infectivity according to species and disease phenotype is one important factor when considering risks for transmission.\n",
            "Technique and pitfalls Since all anti-PrP antibodies that are currently used in immunohistochemistry do not distinguish between PrPC and PrPSc, specific pre-treatment of tissue sections is required for a prion disease diagnosis to abolish simultaneous reactivity with PrPC, just as tissue extracts have to undergo proteinase K digestion before detection of PrPresby immunoblotting.\n",
            "In our hands as well as those of others, a protocol using formic acid, guanidine thiocyanate, and hydrated autoclavinggave the strongest and most consistent signals for formol-fixed and paraffin-embedded brain tissue.\n",
            "Minor modifications have been recommended, but are not necessary for optimal immunostaining.\n",
            "It should be noted that the possibility of pitfalls requires extensive experience in technique and interpretation.\n",
            "Sometimes unspecific labelling of diffuse neuronal somata, dystrophic neurites, ²/A4 amyloid, and neurofibrillary tangles may be seen, probably representing incomplete abolishment of PrPC immunoreactivity.\n",
            "Thus, diagnostic interpretation of positive labelling has to be made by experienced observers and must consider the morphology of obtained signals.\n",
            "Antibodies such as 6H4 and 12F10 failed to give this type of labelling and are, therefore, less likely to recognise non-pathological PrP material in immunohistochemistry.\n",
            "Patterns and distribution of PrP deposition Characteristic patterns of PrP deposition are synaptic, that is the most difficult to reveal, patchy/perivacuolar, and plaque types [Plate X(C)] and which may overlap in the individual brain; sometimes prominent perineuronal deposits surround neuronal somata and processes.\n",
            "Frequencies of these patterns differ between cerebral and cerebellar cortex.\n",
            "Synaptic-type deposits and unicentric PrP plaques occur both in CJD and GSS, while abundant multicentric plaques are peculiar to GSS.\n",
            "Plaque-like deposits are the only type of PrP deposits extending to the subcortical white matter and are more frequent than true compact Kuru-type plaques with fringed outline that are clearly visible without immunohistochemistry [Plate X(E)].\n",
            "They also stain with periodic acid-Schiff, alcian blue, Congo Red (staining disappears after formic acid treatment) and thioflavine S. Kuru plaques decorate a minority of sporadic CJD brains and are most frequent in the cerebellar cortex where they are usually confined to the granular layer.\n",
            "While very rarely ‘florid’ or ‘daisy-like’ plaques may be observed in other prion diseases, their prominence is restricted to vCJD [Plate X(F)].\n",
            "As with spongiform change, also type and distribution of PrP deposition in sporadic CJD were\n",
            "shown to depend upon PrPres fragment size and PRNP codon 129 genotype.\n",
            "New patterns of PrP deposition in the PNS and vessel walls In currently past, granular ganglionic and tiny adaxonal PrP deposits were described in spinal and vegetative ganglia, spinal roots and peripheral nerves in rare cases of human prion disease and experimental scrapie.\n",
            "It remains to be established by sequential studies whether this involvement of the peripheral nervous system reflects centripetal or centrifugal spread of PrP deposition and follows the pathways of travel by the infectious agent.\n",
            "In sporadic and variant CJD, we also found PrPdeposits in intracranial vessel walls by immunohistochemistry and paraffinembedded tissue blotting.\n",
            "Using double immunofluorescence, these deposits co-localise with HLA-DR and S-100 immunoreactive cells in the intima, which are components of the vascular-associated dendritic cell network, as well as with HLA-DR and CD-68 immunopositive macrophages of the intima and media.\n",
            "Thus, mobile haematogenous cells in vessel walls may be involved in the spread of disease-associated prion protein and possibly also of infectivity.\n",
            "One enigma of prion diseases remains the pathogenesis of brain tissue damage, in particular of neuronal drop-out and subsequent tissue loss that is generally much more striking in human than in animal and experimental prion diseases.\n",
            "In principle, models involving a neurotoxic gain of function (most likely for aggregated PrPSc) or loss of function (of PrPC) are conceivable and might even co-operate to manifest disease.\n",
            "A variety of studies were interpreted to support either model, or even both.\n",
            "Both in human and experimental prion diseases, oxidative stress was identified as an important pathogenetic event.\n",
            "Neuronal loss appears to follow an apoptotic pathway that is apparently independent of local deposition of PrPSc but correlates with astrogliosis, microglial activation and axonal damage.\n",
            "Specific vulnerability of a peculiar, parvalbumin-expressing subset of inhibitory GABAergic neurons was found both in human and experimental prion diseases.\n",
            "In fact, this vulnerability was detectable early in the incubation period and thus represents the earliest changes ever described after experimental inoculation.\n",
            "However, FFI differs in such vulnerability from all other human prion diseases.\n",
            "Other vulnerabilities include that of the granular layer of the cerebellum that is frequently depleted in sporadic CJD, and variable involvement of the basal nucleus of Meynert, either mainly or secondarily to cortical neuronal loss.\n",
            "The molecular basis for such selective neuronal vulnerabilities is still obscure.\n",
            "Demyelinative diseases of the central nervous system are characterized by loss of myelin with variable loss of axons.\n",
            "Contrarily, infarcts, contusions, encephalitis, and other conditions destroy myelin and axons equally.\n",
            "The main demyelinative disease of the CNS is multiple sclerosis (MS) and its variants.\n",
            "Its counterpart in the peripheral nervous system is inflammatory demyelinative polyradiculoneuropathy (Guillain-Barré syndrome-GBS) and its chronic variants.\n",

            "There are also virus-induced demyelinative diseases, like progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.\n",
            "Demyelinative diseases should be distinguished from leukodystrophies, which are inherited metabolic disorders of myelin lipids and proteins.\n",
            "MS affects one in every 500 persons, women twice as frequently as men.\n",
            "It is more common in young adults and causes a variety of neurological deficits (visual loss, paralysis, sensory loss, ataxia, brainstem signs, psychiatric disorders, dementia).\n",
            "Various MS cases evolve over a long period (20-30 years) with remissions and exacerbations.\n",

            "course, and others go into a relentlessly progressive phase after a period of remissions and exacerbations.\n",
            "The pathology is characterized by multifocal lesions, the MS plaques.\n",
            "The usual evolution of the MS plaque is as follows: in the acute phase (active plaque), activated mononuclear cells, including lymphocytes, microglia, and macrophages destroy myelin and, to a variable degree, oligodendrocytes.\n",
            "Myelin debris are picked up by macrophages and degraded.\n",
            "At an early stage, macrophages contain myelin fragments; later, they contain proteins and lipids from chemical degradation of myelin.\n",
            "This evolution takes a few weeks.\n",
            "With time, gliosis develops, and plaques reach a burned-out stage consisting of demyelinated axons traversing glial scar tissue (inactive plaque).\n",
            "Remaining oligodendrocytes attempt to make new myelin.\n",
            "If the inflammatory process is arrested at an early phase, plaques are partially remyelinated (shadow plaque).\n",
            "In more advanced lesions, remyelination is ineffective because gliosis creates a barrier between the myelin producing cells and their axonal targets.\n",
            "The pathological process may be arrested at any time, sometimes after partial demyelination.\n",
            "The pattern described above is variable.\n",
            "In most cases, the inflammatory reaction subsides only to appear at another location or at another time.\n",
            "Some lesions expand at their periphery while activity in their center dies down (smoldering plaque).\n",
            "In fulminant MS cases, large lesions with diffuse activity develop and expand inexorably.\n",
            "Although myelin is preferentially affected, axonal loss is significant, and necrosis and cavitation may develop, especially in severe, acute lesions.\n",
            "In H&E stains, plaques appear pale compared to normal white matter.\n",
            "Active lesions are cellular because they contain inflammatory cells and reactive astrocytes.\n",

            "Monozygotic twins are 25.9% concordant for MS; dizygotic twins are only 2.3% concordant.\n",
            "Genetic susceptibility is probably conferred by MHC molecules that modulate the immune response (particularly autoimmunity) and cell-cell interactions.\n",

            "Environmental factors:The incidence of MS is higher in high latitude zones.\n",
            "Prevalence in the northern US is 4-6 times higher than in the South.\n",
            "Individuals who grow up in high prevalence areas retain the high risk even if they subsequently migrate to lowrisk regions.\n",
            "These findings suggest that an unknown predisposing factor is acquired by prolonged exposure to some environments.\n",
            "Viruses, particularly measles and HTLV-1, have been suspected (but not proven) to be involved in the pathogenesis of MS.\n",
            "There are several immunological abnormalities apparent in MS, including perivascular T- and B-lymphocytes, activation of T- lymphocytes, intrathecal immunoglobulin production, and the presence of immunoglobulins, complement, and cytokines in the plaques.\n",

            "Infections such as URIs stimulate secretion of INF gamma by immune cells and exacerbate MS. On the other hand, INF beta, which suppresses the immune response, decreases the frequency of attacks.\n",
            "The first event in the pathogenesis of MS may be a viral infection in childhood.\n",
            "Activated T- lymphocytes generated during such an infection cross the blood- brain barrier and become\n",
            "sensitized to myelin antigens.\n",
            "Alternatively, lymphocytes are sensitized to viral proteins that may have some similarity to myelin proteins.\n",
            "How, after remaining latent for years, these lymphocytes re-enter the CNS and initiate an immune reaction against myelin is a subject of speculation.\n",
            "B-lymphocytes entering acute plaques become sensitized and produce antibodies to myelin antigens.\n",
            "Myelin, oligodendroglial cells, and axons are damaged by inflammatory cytokines, glutamate, NO, and other toxic substances produced by microglia/macrophages.\n",
            "While the agents of CNS damage are the same, the immune reactions that initiate and propagate the process may vary among different forms of MS.\n",
            "The neurologic deficits, in MS, are following loss of myelin and axons.\n",
            "Demyelination causes loss of saltatory conduction.\n",
            "Linear conduction along demyelinated axons is slow because the internodal axon membrane has few ion channels.\n",
            "In addition, lack of insulation of axons allows impulses to disperse laterally to adjacent demyelinated axons.\n",
            "The abnormal physiology of demyelinated axons results in inefficient conduction or conduction block.\n",
            "This is reflected by abnormal evoked response potentials, an electrodiagnostic test that measures conduction velocity in the CNS.\n",
            "Loss of axons, which occurs during the acute inflammatory phase of the disease, explains the permanent disability.\n",
            "While loss of function is easy to explain, clinical recovery is not.\n",
            "Remyelination is limited and does not fully explain the remissions.\n",
            "The neurological deficit from an acute MS plaque is caused not only by the loss of myelin and axons, but also by inflammation and edema that involve a wide area around the lesion.\n",
            "Even without remyelination, neurological function returns to some extent when the inflammatory reaction subsides and homeostasis is restored.\n",
            "In tracts that are partially involved by MS lesions, remaining axons may carry out the function.\n",
            "New ion channels may develop on axonal membrane, helping demyelinated axons conduct more efficiently.\n",
